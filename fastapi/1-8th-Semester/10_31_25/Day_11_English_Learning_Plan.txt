Convert these into reported speech:
1. Ahmad said, "I fixed the pipeline issue."
2. The manager said, "We will deploy the update tomorrow."

The deployment for the BGS AI project was completed successfully today. However, we noticed latency issues in the staging environment during testing. I am investigating the root cause and will share updates shortly.
