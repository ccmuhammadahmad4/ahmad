### Q6. What is NPV (Net Present Value)?

**Answer:**
```
NPV - NET PRESENT VALUE
│
DEFINITION:
└─ Difference between present value of cash inflows and present value of cash outflows over time

FORMULA:
NPV = Σ [Cash Flow ÷ (1+r)^t] - Initial Investment

WHERE:
├─ r = Discount rate (required rate of return)
├─ t = Time period (year)
└─ Σ = Sum of all periods

DECISION RULE:
├─ NPV > 0 → ACCEPT (project creates value) ✅
├─ NPV = 0 → Breakeven (indifferent)
├─ NPV < 0 → REJECT (project destroys value) ❌

EXAMPLE:
Investment: Rs. 100,000
Annual cash flow: Rs. 30,000 for 5 years
Discount rate: 10%

Year 1: 30,000 ÷ 1.1 = 27,273
Year 2: 30,000 ÷ 1.21 = 24,793
Year 3: 30,000 ÷ 1.331 = 22,539
Year 4: 30,000 ÷ 1.464 = 20,490
Year 5: 30,000 ÷ 1.61 = 18,628
Total PV = 113,723
NPV = 113,723 - 100,000 = Rs. 13,723 ✅ ACCEPT

ADVANTAGES:
├─ Considers time value of money
├─ Accounts for entire project life
└─ Shows actual value created

WHY TIME VALUE OF MONEY MATTERS:
└─ Rs. 100 today worth more than Rs. 100 next year
   (Can invest and earn returns)
```

---

### Q7. What is IRR (Internal Rate of Return)?

**Answer:**
```
IRR - INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN
│
DEFINITION:
└─ The discount rate that makes NPV = 0

MEANING:
└─ The rate of return the project is expected to generate

FORMULA:
0 = Σ [Cash Flow ÷ (1+IRR)^t] - Initial Investment
(Solve for IRR)

DECISION RULE:
├─ IRR > Required Rate of Return → ACCEPT ✅
├─ IRR = Required Rate of Return → Breakeven
└─ IRR < Required Rate of Return → REJECT ❌

EXAMPLE:
Project IRR = 15%
Company's required return = 10%
Decision: ACCEPT (earning 15% > required 10%)

INTERPRETATION:
├─ Higher IRR = Better project
├─ Shows percentage return
└─ Easy to understand (percentage)

USE CASE:
└─ Comparing projects of different sizes
   (IRR is %, not absolute amount like NPV)

CALCULATION:
└─ Usually done using Excel, calculator, or software
   (Trial and error method)
```

---

### Q8. What is payback period?

**Answer:**
```
PAYBACK PERIOD
│
DEFINITION:
└─ Time required to recover the initial investment from project cash flows

FORMULA:
Payback Period = Initial Investment ÷ Annual Cash Flow
(For equal annual cash flows)

DECISION RULE:
├─ Shorter payback = Better ✅
├─ Compare with company's required payback period
└─ If payback > maximum acceptable → REJECT ❌

EXAMPLE:
Investment: Rs. 500,000
Annual cash flow: Rs. 125,000
Payback = 500,000 ÷ 125,000 = 4 years

If company requires payback within 3 years → REJECT
If company accepts up to 5 years → ACCEPT

ADVANTAGES:
├─ Simple to calculate
├─ Easy to understand
└─ Focuses on liquidity

DISADVANTAGES:
├─ Ignores time value of money
├─ Ignores cash flows after payback
└─ Doesn't measure profitability

BEST USED WHEN:
├─ Quick screening needed
├─ Cash flow is critical
└─ High uncertainty about future
```

---

### Q9-Q20: Additional Short Questions

**Q9. What is BCR (Benefit-Cost Ratio)?**
```
BCR = Present Value of Benefits ÷ Present Value of Costs

DECISION:
├─ BCR > 1 → ACCEPT (benefits exceed costs) ✅
├─ BCR = 1 → Breakeven
└─ BCR < 1 → REJECT (costs exceed benefits) ❌

EXAMPLE:
PV Benefits: Rs. 150,000
PV Costs: Rs. 100,000
BCR = 1.5 → For every Rs. 1 spent, get Rs. 1.5 back ✅
```

│
├─ 7.4 GET FORMAL APPROVAL
│   ├─ Present to sponsor
│   ├─ Address concerns
│   ├─ Obtain sign-off
│   └─ Distribute approved plan
│
└─ 7.5 BASELINE THE PLAN
    ├─ Scope baseline
    ├─ Schedule baseline
    ├─ Cost baseline
    └─ Use for performance measurement

PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN STRUCTURE:

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
2. PROJECT OVERVIEW
   ├─ Background
   ├─ Objectives
   └─ Success criteria
3. SCOPE MANAGEMENT
   ├─ Scope statement
   ├─ WBS
   └─ Change control process
4. SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT
   ├─ Schedule (Gantt chart)
   ├─ Milestones
   └─ Critical path
5. COST MANAGEMENT
   ├─ Budget
   ├─ Cost baseline
   └─ Payment schedule
6. QUALITY MANAGEMENT
7. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
8. COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT
9. RISK MANAGEMENT
10. PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
11. STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT
12. APPENDICES

OUTPUT:
└─ Approved, baselined Project Management Plan

IMPORTANCE:
├─ Single source of truth
├─ Guides execution and monitoring
├─ Communication tool
└─ Contract baseline

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

KEY SUCCESS FACTORS FOR PROJECT PLANNING:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT ✅
   └─ Include team and stakeholders in planning

2. REALISTIC ESTIMATES ✅
   └─ Don't be overly optimistic

3. ADEQUATE TIME ✅
   └─ Don't rush planning phase

4. DOCUMENTED & APPROVED ✅
   └─ Written plan with formal approval

5. FLEXIBLE BUT CONTROLLED ✅
   └─ Allow changes through change control

6. CONTINUOUS REFINEMENT ✅
   └─ Update plan as needed (progressive elaboration)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

COMMON PLANNING MISTAKES TO AVOID:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

❌ 1. INSUFFICIENT DETAIL
   └─ Plan too high-level, lacks specifics

❌ 2. UNREALISTIC DEADLINES
   └─ Pressure from management leads to impossible timelines

❌ 3. IGNORING RISKS
   └─ "Hope for the best" approach

❌ 4. POOR STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
   └─ Plan developed in isolation

❌ 5. NO BASELINE
   └─ Can't measure progress without baseline

❌ 6. RIGID PLANNING
   └─ No change control process

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PLANNING EFFORT GUIDELINE:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Typical planning effort: 10-20% of total project time

Small project (3 months): 1-2 weeks planning
Medium project (6 months): 3-4 weeks planning
Large project (1+ year): 6-8 weeks planning

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CONCLUSION:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Proper project planning:
✅ Provides clear direction
✅ Reduces risks by 60%
✅ Improves success rate by 2.5x
✅ Enables effective monitoring and control
✅ Aligns team and stakeholders
✅ Establishes baselines for measurement

"Failing to plan is planning to fail" - True in project management!
