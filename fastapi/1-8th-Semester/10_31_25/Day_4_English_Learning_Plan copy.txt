Day 4 - English Learning Plan for Muhammad Ahmad
------------------------------------------------

👋 Welcome to Day 4, Ahmad! You're doing a great job. Let's continue building your English skills for meetings, emails, and presentations.

1. 📘 Grammar Focus: Future Tense (will / going to)
--------------------------------------------------
We use the future tense to talk about actions that will happen later.

- **"will"** is used for decisions made at the moment of speaking or predictions.
  Example: I will deploy the update tonight.

- **"going to"** is used for planned actions.
  Example: I am going to monitor the logs after lunch.

🎯 Practice:
Write 2 sentences using "will" and 2 using "going to" about your DevOps tasks.

2. 🧠 Vocabulary: 5 New Words
-----------------------------
| Word         | Meaning                            | Example Sentence                          |
|--------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Outage**   | A period when service is unavailable | We had a server outage last night.       |
| **Latency**  | Delay in processing or response     | The API latency increased after the update. |
| **Script**   | A set of commands in a file         | I wrote a script to automate the backup. |
| **Trigger**  | To start a process automatically    | The job is triggered after every commit. |
| **Alert**    | A warning message                   | We received an alert about high CPU usage.|

🎧 Optional: Practice pronunciation by reading each word aloud.

3. ✉️ Writing Practice: Email to Team
-------------------------------------
**Prompt:**  
Write an email to your team informing them that you will perform a deployment tomorrow at 6 PM, and there may be a short downtime.

**Example:**
Subject: Scheduled Deployment - Tomorrow at 6 PM

Dear Team,  
I would like to inform you that I will perform a deployment for the BGS AI project tomorrow at 6 PM.  
There may be a short downtime during the process. Please let me know if you have any concerns.  

Regards,  
Muhammad Ahmad

🎯 Your Turn: Write your own version and review it for grammar and tone.

4. 🗣️ Speaking Practice: Describe a Problem
-------------------------------------------
🎤 Prompt:  
Describe a technical issue you faced recently and how you solved it.

**Example:**
Last week, we had a DNS issue that caused a service outage. I investigated the logs and found a missing DNS entry. I updated the configuration and restarted the service. The issue was resolved within 30 minutes.

🎯 Practice Tip:
- Speak slowly and clearly.
- Use past tense to describe what happened.
- Record yourself and listen to improve pronunciation.
