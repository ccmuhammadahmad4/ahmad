**Graph showing real-time traffic patterns**

```
9 AM: ▂▃▅▆█ Peak traffic
↓
Insight: Schedule marketing campaigns at 8:30 AM

```

### Business Decisions:
1. **Marketing**: Best time to send campaigns

```

### Business Decisions:
1. **Support**: Staff up during peaks
2. **Sales**: Best time for outreach
3. **Product**: Feature validation

### ROI Example:
```
Proactive scaling prevented 3 outages
Each outage = $100K lost revenue
