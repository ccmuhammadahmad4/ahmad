PROJECT STRUCTURE
LECTURE 2 – PROJECT MANAGEMENT

INTRODUCTION
AFTER UNDERSTANDING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PROJECT, NOW WE SEE
HOW DO WE STRUCTURE A PROJECT SMOOTHLY?

• PROJECT STRUCTURE IS THE FORMAL ARRANGEMENT OF ROLES,
RESPONSIBILITIES & COMMUNICATION.
• PROJECT STRUCTURE DETERMINES HOW RESOURCES ARE ORGANIZED
AND MANAGED TO ACHIEVE OBJECTIVES.
• PROJECT STRUCTURE SUPPORT DECISION-MAKING EFFICIENCY BY WHO
DECIDES WHAT AND HOW INFORMATION FLOW
• EXAMPLE: LIKE A CRICKET TEAM – CLEAR ROLES AVOID CHAOS.

WHY PROJECT STRUCTURE IS
IMPORTANT
• CLARITY OF ROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES – TO AVOIDS
DUPLICATION EVERYONE KNOWS THEIR TASK.
• IMPROVED COMMUNICATION – CLEAR REPORTING LINES.

• DECISION-MAKING EFFICIENCY – FASTER RESPONSES.
• COORDINATION OF RESOURCES – TIME, MONEY, PEOPLE,
TECHNOLOGY ARE ALLOCATED PROPERLY.
• CONFLICT RESOLUTION – HIERARCHY DECIDES FINAL WORD.
LET IN A GROUP PROJECT, IF TWO MEMBERS BOTH ASSUME
LEADERSHIP, CONFLICT ARISES. A DEFINED STRUCTURE PREVENTS
THIS.

ELEMENTS OF PROJECT STRUCTURE

• PROJECT MANAGER – LEADER & COORDINATOR. RESPONSIBLE FOR PLANNING,
EXECUTION, AND DELIVERY.

• PROJECT TEAM MEMBERS – SPECIALISTS DOING TASKS FROM DIFFERENT AREAS (
PROGRAMMERS, DESIGNERS, QA TESTERS)
• DECISION-MAKING AUTHORITY – WHO DECIDES FINANCIAL, TECHNICAL, SCHEDULING,
AND PREVENT CONFUSION IN CRISIS
• COMMUNICATION CHANNELS – DEFINE HOW INFORMATION FLOWS (MEETINGS,
REPORTS). HELPS IN COORDINATION
• WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE (WBS) – BREAKING PROJECT INTO MODULES/TASKS.
EACH TASK HAS CLEAR RESPONSIBILITY AND DELIVERABILITY.

WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE
EXAMPLE
• E-COMMERCE PROJECT DIVIDED INTO:
• 1. USER LOGIN SYSTEM

• 2. PRODUCT CATALOG
• 3. SHOPPING CART
• 4. PAYMENT GATEWAY

TYPES OF PROJECT STRUCTURES:
FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURE
• HANDLED WITHIN DEPARTMENTS (E.G., IT BUILDS STUDENT PORTAL).
• EACH DEPARTMENT CONTRIBUTES ITS EXPERTISE.

• PROS: SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE, EFFICIENCY.
• CONS: SLOW DECISIONS, WEAK COORDINATION.
LET IT DEPARTMENT DEVELOPING SOFTWARE WHILE REPORTINF TO
HEAD OF IT.

TYPES OF PROJECT STRUCTURES:
PROJECTIZED STRUCTURE
• DEDICATED TEAM FORMED FOR THE PROJECT.

• PROJECT MANAGER HAS FULL AUTHORITY
• PROS: FAST DECISIONS, STRONG FOCUS, CLEAR ACCOUNTABILITY.
• CONS: EXPENSIVE, DUPLICATION OF RESOURCES.
EXAMPLE: A UNIVERSITY CREATED A SPECIAL TEAM TO DEVELOP ITS OWN
LEARNING MANADGEMENT SYSTEM.

TYPES OF PROJECT STRUCTURES:
MATRIX
• BLEND OF FUNCTIONAL + PROJECTIZED.
• DUAL REPORTING (FUNCTIONAL BOSS + PROJECT MANAGER).

• PROS: EFFICIENT RESOURCE USE, SHARED KNOWLEDGE.
• CONS: CONFUSION FROM TWO BOSSES.

TYPES OF PROJECT STRUCTURES: TEAMBASED (AGILE)
• MODERN FLEXIBLE APPROACH.
• CROSS-FUNCTIONAL SMALL TEAMS.

• PROS: FLEXIBILITY, INNOVATION, FAST RESPONSE.
• CONS: NEEDS MATURITY & STRONG COMMUNICATION.

DECISION-MAKING IN STRUCTURES
DECISION MAKING VARIES BASED ON STRUCTURE
• FUNCTIONAL: SLOW (FOLLOW HIERARCHY).
• PROJECTIZED: FAST (PROJECT MANAGER AUTHORITY).

• MATRIX: BALANCED BUT CONFUSING.
• AGILE/TEAM-BASED: COLLABORATIVE, ADAPTIVE.
• COOKE & SLACK: BEST STRUCTURE REDUCES UNCERTAINTY.

CASE EXAMPLE: E-GOVERNMENT TAX
PROJECT
• PROJECT: ONLINE TAX FILING SYSTEM.
• STRUCTURE: MATRIX (FBR STAFF + PRIVATE SOFTWARE HOUSE).

• WHY MATRIX? COMBINES LEGAL & TECHNICAL EXPERTISE.
• RESULT: SUCCESS BUT INITIAL DELAYS DUE TO DUAL REPORTING.

CONCLUSION

• PROJECT STRUCTURE = BACKBONE OF PROJECT SUCCESS.
• ENSURES CLARITY, COORDINATION, DECISION-MAKING.

• FOUR COMMON TYPES: FUNCTIONAL, PROJECTIZED, MATRIX, AGILE.
• BEST STRUCTURE DEPENDS ON PROJECT SIZE, COMPLEXITY, CULTURE.
• TAKEAWAY: STRONG STRUCTURE = HIGHER SUCCESS CHANCE.
