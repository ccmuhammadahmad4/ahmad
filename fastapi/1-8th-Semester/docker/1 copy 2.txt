INTERVIEW QUESTIONS: DOCKER-COMPOSE
==============================

Q1: What is the purpose of docker-compose in a DevOps workflow?
Answer: Docker Compose simplifies the management of multi-container applications by defining services, networks, and volumes in a single YAML file.
Explanation: Shows understanding of orchestration and infrastructure-as-code principles.

---

Q2: How does docker-compose differ from running containers manually with docker run?
Answer: Docker Compose allows defining multiple services in one file and manages their lifecycle together, while `docker run` handles one container at a time.
Explanation: Demonstrates efficiency and automation awareness.

---

Q3: What happens when you run `docker-compose up` without the `-d` flag?
Answer: It starts the services in the foreground and streams logs to the terminal.
Explanation: Shows knowledge of interactive vs detached modes.

---

Q4: How do you define environment variables in a docker-compose file?
Answer: You can use `environment:` block or reference an `.env` file.
Explanation: Demonstrates configuration management skills.

---

Q5: What is the difference between `depends_on` and actual container readiness?
Answer: `depends_on` controls startup order but doesn’t wait for the service to be ready. For readiness, use healthchecks.
Explanation: Shows deep understanding of service orchestration.

---

Q6: How would you scale a service using docker-compose?
Answer: Use `docker-compose up --scale <service>=<count>` to run multiple instances.
Explanation: Demonstrates horizontal scaling knowledge.

---

Q7: How do you persist data across container restarts in docker-compose?
Answer: Use named volumes defined in the `volumes:` section.
Explanation: Shows understanding of persistent storage.

---

Q8: What is the role of networks in docker-compose?
Answer: Networks allow services to communicate securely. Compose creates a default network unless specified.
Explanation: Demonstrates container networking knowledge.

---

Q9: How do you override settings in a docker-compose file?
Answer: Use multiple Compose files with `-f` flag or override values in `.env`.
Explanation: Shows flexibility and environment-specific deployment skills.

---

Q10: How do you troubleshoot a failing service in docker-compose?
Answer: Use `docker-compose logs`, `docker-compose ps`, and `docker-compose config` to inspect logs, status, and configuration.
Explanation: Demonstrates practical debugging workflow.

Would you like me to generate this as a downloadable `.txt` file named `docker-compose.txt`?

Also, I can prepare similar files for:
- **Kubernetes YAML**
- **Terraform**
- **Jenkins pipelines**
- **AWS ECS/EKS**
