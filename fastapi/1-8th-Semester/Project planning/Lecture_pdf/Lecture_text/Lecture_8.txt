Project Planning and
Monitoring
Project Conception and
Feasibility

What is Project
Conception?
• Beginning of a Project is the initial step in the
process of defining the actual scope of a project.
• Project conception generally starts with an appearance
of a requirement or an opportunity that will benefit the
corporate interests and ends when one or more
preliminary options have been formulated which will,
theoretically, satisfy the company’s expectations as
originally presented.

Stages of Project Conception
• Initial conceptualization of a project has various degrees of complexity, depending on the nature
of
the specific project and the particular analysis and approval procedures used by an
organization.
• The organization’s planning strategy may require formulations of programs involving
several
projects. Conception of the overall program should then precede conception
of the individual
specific projects.

• The conceptual stage involves the following activities:
1. Definition of a requirement or an opportunity that commands the interests of
the company.
2. Formulation of a set of preliminary alternatives capable of fulfilling the initial
requirement.

3. Selection of alternative(s) that might satisfy the requirements in terms and
conditions
attractive to the organization

1. Definition of the Requirement or Opportunity
• The continuity of efficient operations and the opening of the
new business areas are the main drives for capital investments for
industrial firms.
Investment
opportunities
are
detected
through operational analysis of current performance and by
forecasts of the most likely future scenarios.
• Initially, the scope of any new investment is likely to be
vague.
Subsequent definition involves consideration of all
available relevant
facts, required resource sand constraints
associated with the original idea.

2. Preliminary Formulation of the Alternatives
• Project conception continues with development of alternatives
capable of fulfilling the expressed objectives.
• The preliminary formulation of alternatives is important as it sets
the pace of the subsequent definition and elaboration of the project
scope.

• During this phase, the organization calls upon the experience
and creativity of its technicians, manager and directors to
generate an
adequate group of alternatives to fulfill the
expressed need.

3. Initial Selection of Alternatives
• After the alternatives have been identified, comparative analyses are made in
order to select the most beneficial and to reject the least attractive.

• The selection process employs a basic feasibility analysis of each
alternative the establishment of criteria that will allow the identification
of the most attractive options.
• At this point, further consideration of the rejected alternative is terminated
along with the need to prepare elaborate definitions for them.
• The cost, schedule, profitability, and other salient advantages and
disadvantages of each of the selected alternatives are assessed in terms of
order of magnitude.
• Difference among the options is sought still without establishing precise
project parameters.

What is a Feasibility Study of a Project?
• In a feasibility study, a proposed plan or project is evaluated for its practicality.
• As part of a feasibility study, a project or venture is evaluated for its viability
in order to determine whether it will be successful.
• As the name implies, a feasibility analysis is used to determine the viability of
an idea, such as ensuring a project is legally and technically feasible as
well as economically justifiable.

Understanding A Feasibility Study
• A feasibility study is a preliminary exploration of a proposed project or
undertaking to determine its merits and viability.
• A feasibility study aims to provide an independent assessment that examines all
aspects of a proposed project, including technical, economic, financial, legal, and
environmental considerations.
• This information then helps decision-makers determine whether or not to
proceed with the project.
• The feasibility study results can also be used to create a realistic project plan and
budget.
• Without a feasibility study, it cannot be easy to know whether or not a proposed
project is worth pursuing.

1. Technical Feasibility

Types of
Feasibility
Study

This assessment focuses on the technical resources
available to the organization. It helps organizations
determine whether the technical resources meet capacity
and whether the technical team is capable of converting
the ideas into working systems. Technical feasibility also
involves the evaluation of the hardware, software, and other
technical requirements of the proposed system.
2. Financial Feasibility

This assessment typically involves a cost/ benefits
analysis of the project, helping organizations determine the
viability, cost, and benefits associated with a project before
financial resources are allocated. It also serves as an
independent project assessment and enhances project
credibility—helping decision-makers determine the positive
financial benefits to the organization that the proposed
project will provide.

3. Managerial Feasibility

Types of
Feasibility
Study

Demonstrated management capability and availability, employee
involvement, and commitment are key elements required to
ascertain managerial feasibility. This addresses the management
and organizational structure of the project, ensuring that the
proponent’s structure is as described in the submittal and is well
suited to the type of operation undertaken.
4. Economic Feasibility

This involves the feasibility of the proposed project to generate
economic benefits. A benefit-cost analysis is required. A
breakeven analysis when appropriate is also a required aspect of
evaluating the economic feasibility of a project. The tangible and
intangible aspects of a project should be translated into economic
terms to facilitate a consistent basis for evaluation. Even when a
project is non-profit in nature, economic feasibility is critical.

5. Legal Feasibility

Types of
Feasibility
Study

This assessment investigates whether any aspect of the
proposed project conflicts with legal requirements like
zoning laws, data protection acts or social media laws.
Let’s say an organization wants to construct a new office
building in a specific location. A feasibility study might
reveal the organization’s ideal location isn’t zoned for that
type of business. That organization has just saved
considerable time and effort by learning that their project
was not feasible right from the beginning.

6. Operational Feasibility
This assessment involves undertaking a study to analyze
and determine whether—and how well—the organization’s
needs can be met by completing the project. Operational
feasibility studies also examine how a project plan satisfies
the requirements identified in the requirements analysis
phase of system development.

Types of
Feasibility
Study

7. Scheduling Feasibility
This assessment is the most important
for project success; after all, a project will fail if
not completed on time. In scheduling feasibility,
an organization estimates how much time the
project will take to complete.
8. Cultural Feasibility
Cultural feasibility deals with the compatibility of the
proposed project with the cultural environment of the
project. In labor-intensive projects, planned functions
must be integrated with the local cultural practices and
beliefs. For example, religious beliefs may influence
what an individual is willing to do or not do.

9. Social Feasibility

Types of
Feasibility
Study

Social feasibility addresses the influences that a proposed project
may have on the social system in the project environment. The
ambient social structure may be such that certain categories of
workers may be in short supply or nonexistent. The effect of the
project on the social status of the project participants must be
assessed to ensure compatibility. It should be recognized that
workers in certain industries may have certain status symbols
within the society.
10. Environmental Feasibility
Environmental feasibility is another important aspect that should
be considered in project planning. Environmental feasibility
refers to an analysis of whether the project is capable of being
implemented and operated safely with minimal adverse effects on
the environment. Unfortunately, environmental impact assessment
is often not adequately addressed in complex projects.

11. Political Feasibility

Types of
Feasibility
Study

Political considerations often dictate directions for a proposed project.
This is particularly true for large projects with significant visibility that
may have significant government inputs and political implications. For
example, political necessity may be a source of support for a project
regardless of the project's merits. On the other hand, worthy projects may
face insurmountable opposition simply because of political factors.
Political feasibility analysis requires an evaluation of the compatibility of
project goals with the prevailing goals of the political system.

12. Market Feasibility
This area should not be confused with the Economic Feasibility. The
market needs analysis to view the potential impacts of market demand,
competitive activities, etc. and market share available. Possible
competitive activities by competitors, whether local, regional, national or
international, must also be analyzed for early contingency funding and
impacts on operating costs during the start-up, ramp-up, and commercial
start-up phases of the project.

Constraints through Feasibility Study
When all areas have been examined, the feasibility analysis helps identify any
constraints the proposed project may face, including:
• Internal Project Constraints: Technical, Technology, Budget, Resource, etc.
• Internal Corporate Constraints: Financial, Marketing, Export, etc.
• External Constraints: Logistics, Environment, Laws, and Regulations, etc.

Importance of Feasibility Study
The importance of a feasibility study is based on organizational desire to
“get it right” before committing resources, time, or budget. A feasibility study
might uncover new ideas that could completely change a project’s scope.
Below are some key benefits of conducting a feasibility study:

• Improves project teams’ focus
• Identifies new opportunities
• Provides valuable information for a “go/no-go” decision

• Narrows the business alternatives
• Identifies a valid reason to undertake the project
• Enhances the success rate by evaluating multiple parameters

• Aids decision-making on the project
• Identifies reasons not to proceed

What is Included in a Feasibility Study
Report?
The results of your feasibility studies study are summarized in a feasibility report,
which typically comprises the following sections:
• Executive summary

• Specifications of the item or service
• Considerations for the future of technology

• The marketplace for goods and services
• Approach to marketing
• Organization/staffing

• Schedule
• The financial forecasts

• Recommendations based on research

Purpose of a Feasibility Study
A feasibility study is an important first step in starting a new business. It is a detailed
examination of whether or not a proposed business venture is likely to be successful.
A feasibility study aims to provide information that will help business owners make
informed decisions about their new venture. The feasibility study will answer important
questions about the proposed business, including:
• What is the target market for this business?

• Who are the competitors?
• What are the costs associated with starting and running this business?
• What are the potential risks and rewards associated with this venture?

• How much revenue can this business generate?
• What are the estimated profits and losses for this business?
• What is the potential for growth in this industry?

7 Steps to Do a
Feasibility Study

1. Conduct
a
Preliminary
Analysis

A preliminary investigation is necessary to
determine whether a full feasibility study is
warranted. During this stage, key information
will be gathered to assess the project's
potential and make a preliminary decision
about its feasibility. This should include a
review of relevant documents, interviews with
key personnel, and surveys of potential
customers or users.

2. Prepare
a Projected
Income
Statement

To do a feasibility study, one must
create a projected income statement.
The projected income statement will
show how much money a business is
expected to make in the coming year. It
will include both an estimated revenue
and an estimated expenses. This
document will be essential in helping
one make informed decisions about
his/her business.

3. Conduct
a Market
Survey, or
Perform
Market
Research

• Conducting market research is an important step in any
feasibility study. By understanding the needs and wants
of potential customers, one can determine if there is a
market for his/her product or service. One can also get
an idea of what his/her competition is doing and how to
best position the business to meet the needs of his/her
target market.
• There are a variety of ways to conduct market research.
One popular method is to conduct a survey. One can
survey potential customers directly or use data from
secondary sources such as surveys conducted by other
organizations. One can also use focus groups or
interviews to get feedback from potential customers.

• Once the data is gathered, one can use it to create a
profile of his/her ideal customer. This will help to
understand the target market and how to reach them.

4. Plan
Business
Organization
and
Operations

When starting a business, one of the first things one
need is to plan his/her organization and operations.
This involves creating a structure for his/her company
and figuring out the logistics of how he/she will run it.
There are many factors to consider when planning
organization and operations, such as:
• Company Structure: What type of company will it
be (sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation,
etc.)? How will the hierarchy look like?
• Location: Where will the business be located?
Will it have a physical storefront or will operate
online only?
• Marketing: How will the business be
promoted ?

5. Prepare
an
Opening
Day
Balance
Sheet

The opening day balance sheet is a snapshot of the
company's financial position at the beginning of the
business venture. The purpose of the opening day
balance sheet is to give an idea of the amount of money
that the company has to work with and track its expenses
and income as they occur. This information is vital to
making sound business decisions. The opening day
balance sheet will include the following:
• Cash on hand

• Accounts receivable
• Inventory
• Prepaid expenses

• Fixed assets
• Accounts payable

• Notes payable
• Long-term liabilities

• Share

6. Review
and
Analyze All
Data

• The feasibility study should include reviewing and
analyzing all data relevant to the proposed project. The
data collected should be verified against source
documentation, and any discrepancies should be noted.
The purpose of the feasibility study is to provide a basis
for making a decision, and the data should be sufficient
to support that decision.
• The analysis should consider both the positive and
negative aspects of the proposed project. The financial
analysis should be thorough, and all assumptions should
be documented. The risk assessment should identify
any potential risks and mitigation strategies. The team
assigned to the project should review the feasibility
study and recommend the organization's leadership.
• Organizational leadership should decide whether to
proceed with the project based on the feasibility study's
findings. If the project is approved, the organization
should develop a project plan that includes a detailed
budget and timeline

7. Make a
Go/No-Go
Decision

• It is important to know when to cut losses when
starting a business. The go/no-go decision in a
feasibility study comes in. The go/no-go decision is a
key part of a feasibility study, and it can help one
determine whether or not his/her business idea is
worth pursuing.
• Making the go/no-go decision is all about risk
assessment. One need to weigh the risks and
rewards of starting his/her business and decide
whether the potential rewards are worth the risks. If
the risks are too high, one may want to reconsider
his/her business idea.
