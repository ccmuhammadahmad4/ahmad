INTERVIEW QUESTIONS: DOCKER
==============================

Q1: What is the difference between a Docker image and a Docker container?
Answer: A Docker image is a blueprint for a container. It contains the application code, libraries, and dependencies. A container is a running instance of an image.
Explanation: This shows understanding of Docker architecture and runtime behavior.

---

Q2: How does Docker ensure isolation between containers?
Answer: Docker uses Linux namespaces and cgroups to isolate containers. Each container has its own network stack, process tree, and filesystem.
Explanation: Demonstrates knowledge of underlying OS-level isolation mechanisms.

---

Q3: What is the purpose of the `docker-compose` tool?
Answer: `docker-compose` allows you to define and run multi-container applications using a YAML file. It simplifies orchestration and service linking.
Explanation: Shows practical understanding of multi-service deployment.

---

Q4: How would you debug a container that is crashing immediately after starting?
Answer: I would use `docker logs <container>` to check logs, then `docker inspect` for metadata. If needed, I’d run the container with an interactive shell using `docker run -it`.
Explanation: Demonstrates troubleshooting skills and command fluency.

---

Q5: What is the difference between `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` in a Dockerfile?
Answer: `CMD` provides default arguments for the container, while `ENTRYPOINT` defines the executable. `ENTRYPOINT` is always run, `CMD` can be overridden.
Explanation: Shows deep understanding of Dockerfile behavior.

---

Q6: How do you persist data in Docker containers?
Answer: By using Docker volumes or bind mounts. Volumes are managed by Docker and are ideal for persistent storage.
Explanation: Highlights awareness of data management in containers.

---

Q7: What is the difference between `docker run` and `docker start`?
Answer: `docker run` creates and starts a new container. `docker start` starts an existing stopped container.
Explanation: Shows understanding of container lifecycle.

---

Q8: How do you reduce the size of a Docker image?
Answer: Use multi-stage builds, remove unnecessary packages, and clean up cache layers. Use minimal base images like Alpine.
Explanation: Demonstrates optimization skills.

---

Q9: What is the role of the Docker daemon?
Answer: The Docker daemon (`dockerd`) manages Docker objects like containers, images, networks. It listens to Docker API requests.
Explanation: Shows understanding of Docker’s architecture.

---

Q10: How would you secure Docker containers in production?
Answer: Use non-root users, limit container capabilities, scan images for vulnerabilities, and isolate containers with user namespaces.
Explanation: Demonstrates security awareness and best practices.

Would you like me to email or export this as a downloadable `.txt` file?  
Also, I can generate similar sheets for **Kubernetes**, **Terraform**, or **AWS services** if you'd like!
