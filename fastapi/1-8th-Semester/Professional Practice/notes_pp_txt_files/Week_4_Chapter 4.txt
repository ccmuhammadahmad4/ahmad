What Is Intellectual Property?
Intellectual property: any unique product of the human intellect that has commercial valueBooks, songs, moviesPaintings, drawingsInventions, chemical formulas, computer programsIntellectual property ≠ physical manifestationIP is intangible personal propertyDoes right to own property extend to intellectual property?

Slide 7

Property Rights
Locke: The Second Treatise of GovernmentPeople have a right…to property in their own personto their own laborto things which they remove from Nature through their laborAs long as…nobody claims more property than they can useafter someone removes something from common state, there is plenty left over

Expanding the Argument to Intellectual Property
Writing a play akin to making a belt buckleBelt buckleMine oreSmelt it downCast itWriting a play“Mine” words from English language“Smelt” them into prose“Cast” them into a complete play

Slide 10
1-10
Analogy Is Imperfect
If Ben Jonson and William Shakespeare simultaneously write down Hamlet, who owns it?If Ben “steals” the play from Will, both have itThese paradoxes weaken the argument for a natural right to intellectual property
Ben Jonson, walker Art Library/Alamy; Shakespeare, Classic Image/Alamy

Benefits of Intellectual Property Protection
Some people are altruistic (Regardful of others; unselfish); some are notAllure of wealth can be an incentive for speculative workAuthors of U.S. Constitution recognized benefits to limited intellectual property protection

Slide 12

1-33

Slide 34
Benefits of Proposed Settlement
Google would pay $125 million to resolve legal claims of authors and publishers and establish Book Rights RegistryReaders would have much easier access to out-of-print books at U.S. public libraries and university librariesUniversity libraries could purchase subscriptions giving their students access to collections of some of world’s greatest librariesAuthors and publishers would receive payments earned from online access of their books, plus share of advertising revenues
1-34

Slide 35
Criticisms of Proposed Settlement
Google should have gone to courtGoogle had a good case that its use was a fair use, based on precedent of Kelly v. Arriba SoftIf Google had been found not guilty of copyright infringement, it could have given public access to books at lower ratesAgreement gives Google a virtual monopoly over orphaned worksPotential chilling effect of Google tracking the pages that people are viewing
1-35

Slide 36
Court Rejects Proposed Settlement
March 2011: U.S. District Court for Southern District of New York rejected proposed settlementJudge ruled agreement would have:Given Google significant advantage over competitorsRewarded Google for “wholesale copying of copyrighted words without permission”Given Google liberal rights over orphaned works

Impact of Open-Source Software
Linux an alternative to proprietary versions of UnixLinux operating system on 95% of the world’s 500 fastest supercomputers

Slide 82
1-82
Crititique of the Open-Source Software Movement
Without critical mass of developers, quality can be poorWithout an “owner,” incompatible versions may ariseRelatively weak graphical user interfacePoor mechanism for stimulating innovation (no companies will spend billions on new programs)

Slide 83
4.9 Legitimacy of Intellectual 	Property Protection for Software
1-83

Slide 84
1-84
Do We Have the Right System in Place?
Software licenses typically prevent you from making copies of software to sell or give awaySoftware licenses are legal agreementsNot discussing morality of breaking the lawDiscussing whether society should give intellectual property protection to software

Slide 85
1-85
Rights-based Analysis
“Just deserts” argumentProgramming is hard work that only a few can doProgrammers should be rewarded for their laborThey ought to be able to own their programsCriticism of “just deserts” argumentWhy does labor imply ownership?Can imagine a just society in which all labor went to common goodIntellectual property not like physical property

Slide 86
A Consequentialist Argument Why Software Copying Is Bad
1-86
Beth Anderson

Slide 87
1-87
Utilitarian Analysis
Argument against copyingCopying software reduces software purchases…Leading to less income for software makers…Leading to lower production of new software…Leading to fewer benefits to societyEach of these claims can be debatedNot all who get free copies can afford to buy softwareOpen-source movement demonstrates many people are willing to donate their software-writing skillsHardware industry wants to stimulate software industryDifficult to quantify how much society would be harmed if certain software packages not released

Slide 88
1-88
Conclusion
Natural rights argument weakUtilitarian argument not strong, eitherNevertheless, society has granted copyright protection to owners of computer programsBreaking the law is wrong unless there is a strong overriding moral obligation or consequence

Slide 89
Case Study: The Database Guru
Salam worked for five years at Felicity Software, where he developed software optimizations that significantly improved the company’s database performance.Felicity treated these optimizations as confidential trade secrets, limiting access to only Salam and a few engineers.Salam signed a confidentiality and proprietary rights agreement on his first day, agreeing not to disclose company secrets during or after employment.The agreement emphasized Felicity’s commercial value in protecting trade secrets and prohibited Salam from sharing or publishing confidential information externally.
1-89

Slide 90
Salam left Felicity and was quickly hired by Unrelated.com, a start-up building a genealogical database platform with a subscription model.Unrelated.com’s business model depends on high-performance database systems to support 50,000 subscribers and up to 10,000 simultaneous users.As VP of Software with a $150,000 salary, Salam oversees teams developing and optimizing the new database system.Salam realizes that the team’s current technical solutions won’t meet the performance goals, as they can only support around 5,000 concurrent users.
1-90

Slide 91
He considers two options:A “clean-room” strategy — guiding the team using public knowledge and performance targets.Indirectly leading the team to rediscover his Felicity optimizations without directly revealing trade secrets.Salam faces an ethical and legal dilemma: respecting his confidentiality obligations while ensuring Unrelated.com’s project succeeds.
1-91

Slide 92
1. He would have access to confidential, secret, and proprietary information related to Felicitys business.2. Felicity placed great competitive importance and commercial value on its ability to reserve confidentialinformation for its exclusive use.3. Confidential information he developed would be covered by this agreement.4. He would not directly or indirectly disclose, publish, communicate or make available confidential information to anyone outside of the company.5. His obligations under the agreement would continue during and after his employment by Felicity
