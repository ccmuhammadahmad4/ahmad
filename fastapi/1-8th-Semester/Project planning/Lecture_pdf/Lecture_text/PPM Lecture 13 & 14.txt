A Classic Case of
Miscommunication
In Center Harbor, when Walter Cronkite steered
his boat into port. The avid sailor was amused to
see in the distance a small crowd on shore waving
their arms to greet him. He could barely make out
their excited shouts: “Hello Walter, Hello Walter!”

A Classic Case of
Miscommunication
As his boat came closer, the crowd grew larger, still
yelling. Pleased at the reception, Cronkite tipped his
white captain's hat, waved back, even took a bow. But
before reaching dockside, Cronkite's boat abruptly
jammed aground. The crowd stood silent. The veteran
suddenly realized what they'd been shouting: “Low
water, low water!”

Barriers That Caused
Cronkite Miscommunication
⚫ Frame of reference

⚫ Receiver accustomed to

acclaim and appreciative
crowds.
⚫ Language skills

⚫ Accent makes "water" and

"Walter" sound similar.
⚫ Receiver more accustomed to
⚫ Listening skills

speaking than to listening.

Barriers That Caused
Cronkite Miscommunication
⚫ Emotional interference

⚫ Ego prompted receiver to

believe crowd was responding
to his celebrity status.
⚫ Physical barriers

⚫ Noise from boat, distance

between senders and
receivers.

Which of these barriers could be overcome through
improved communication skills?

Project Communication Management
Project Communications Management includes the
processes required to ensure timely appropriate
generation, collection, distribution, storage, retrieval
and ultimate disposition of project information. The
Project Communications Management processes
provide the critical links among people and
information that are necessary for successful
communications.

Importance of Good Communications
 The greatest threat to many projects is a failure to

communicate.
 Our culture does not portray IT professionals as being

good communicators.
 Research shows that IT professionals must be able to

communicate effectively to succeed in their positions.
 Strong verbal skills are a key factor in career

advancement for IT professionals.

36

Project Communications Management Processes
• Plan Communications Management: the process of developing

an approach and plan for all project-based communication
activities based on the information needs of each stakeholder,
available resources in the organization, and the needs of a
project.
• Manage Communications : the process of creating, collecting,
distributing, storing, accessing, managing, monitoring, and
disposing of project information.
• Monitor Communications: the process of ensuring that the
information needs of project stakeholders, as well as the project,
are met.
37

Generally, a project management communication plan
should answer the following key questions:
⚫ Who? Who needs to know?

⚫ What? What do they need to know?
⚫ When? How frequently?
⚫ Where? Where are communications required?

⚫ Why? Why is this important?
⚫ How? How are they kept informed?

38

Who? Stakeholder Identification
Did you think of everyone?
If you are designing an application in this project,
have you included the end-users in the early project
communications?
If your end-user works for another organization such
as a local or city government or a voluntary agency,
have you also kept the IT people in those entities
informed?
39

What? Stakeholder Analysis
⚫ Tendency to send too much to too many – very easy to

do with electronic communications! Too much is as
bad as too little – can’t read everything.
⚫ Target your audiences – and realize you may have more

than one.

40

When ?
⚫ How often?
⚫ Morning & afternoon?
⚫ Day of week?
⚫ Day of month?
⚫ Different intervals for various stakeholders

– Weekly for team members
– Bi-weekly for sponsor
– Monthly for Executives
– Etc.
41

Where ?
⚫ Location for status meetings

⚫ Location for team meetings
⚫ Locations for information: Network drive, website,

internal or external, Email attachments, Email text

42

Why ?
⚫ Curiosity? Good/bad

⚫ Need to know?
⚫ Provide information
⚫ Prepare end-users for transition

⚫ MANY REASONS TO SHARE INFORMATION!

43

How ?
⚫ Emails

⚫ Status reports
⚫ Phone calls
⚫ Meetings

⚫ Face to face, one on one
⚫ Press release
⚫ Other?

44

Plan Communications Management
⚫ During the plan communications management process,

project managers, together with the project team, develop
a project communication plan that details your
communication management system or approach.

⚫ The group should specify how it intends to address

stakeholders’ communication needs throughout the project
using assets available within the organization. Different
stakeholders have different communication expectations.

45

Communications Management Plan Contents
• The message or information to be communicated

• Communication distribution frequency and schedule
• Communication modes, such as email, text messages, face-to-

face communication, meetings, reports on the status
of deliverables and project milestones, etc.
• The stakeholders who are receiving the information
• The team member(s) responsible for delivering content and
responding to questions or requests
• Communication constraints (e.g., budget allotted for
communication, schedule, communication technology,
internal and external policies, legislation requiring
communications to be handled a certain way, etc.)
46

Communications Management Plan Contents (cont’d)
⚫ Input documents you will need in order to create your

communication plan may include:
• A project charter

• A stakeholder register
• A resource allocation and management plan

⚫ Although the project communication plan is created

during the project planning phase, you may have to
repeat the process as the project’s communication
requirements change. If stakeholders are added to or
removed from the project, the plan will have to be
revisited.
47

Sample Stakeholder Analysis for Project
Communications

48

Manage Communications
⚫ In this process, project managers and their teams

execute the tasks and activities defined in the
communication plan, i.e., the collection, creation,
storage,
retrieval,
management,
distribution,
monitoring, and disposal of project information.

⚫ The goal is to provide timely, accurate information to

the right people using the appropriate project
communication tools.

49

Manage Communications (Cont)
⚫ Besides information distribution, this is also where

you encourage stakeholders to ask questions or
discuss any lingering doubts or confusion they may
have regarding the project, so you can provide
clarification.

⚫ Communication is a two-way street. Not only should

you provide the information to the right recipients at
the right time, but you also have to make certain they
receive and understand the information you send out.
50

Manage Communications (Cont)
⚫ Documents created during this process include:
• Performance reports
• Presentations
• Schedule updates
• Updates on the status of the project’s deliverables

⚫ Certain project documents may have to be updated,

too, such as the communication management plan,
project plan, stakeholder register, stakeholder
engagement plan, and the lessons learned register.
⚫ Communications management occurs throughout
the project’s life cycle.

51

Manage Communications (Cont)
 Getting the right information to the right people at

the right time and in a useful format is just as
important as developing the information in the first
place.
 Important considerations include:
 Using technology to enhance information distribution.
 Formal and informal methods for distributing

information.

52

Distributing Information in an Effective
and Timely Manner
 Don’t bury crucial information.
 Don’t be afraid to report bad information.

 Oral communication via meetings and informal talks

helps bring important information—good and bad—out
into the open.

53

Importance of Face-to-Face
Communication
 Research says that in a face-to-face interaction:
 58 percent of communication is through body language.
 35 percent of communication is through how the words
are said.
 7 percent of communication is through the content or
words that are spoken.
 Pay attention to more than just the actual words

someone is saying.
 A person’s tone of voice and body language say a lot
about how he or she really feels.
54

Encouraging More Face-to-Face
Interactions
 Short, frequent meetings are often very effective in

projects.
 Stand-up meetings force people to focus on what they

really need to communicate.
 Some companies have policies preventing the use of e-

mail between certain hours or even entire days of the
week.
55

Media Choice Table

56

Understanding Group and Individual
Communication Needs
 People are not interchangeable parts.
 As illustrated in Brooks’ book The Mythical Man-Month,

you cannot assume that a task originally scheduled to
take two months of one person’s time can be done in one
month by two people.

57

Personal Preferences Affect
Communication Needs
 Introverts like more private communications, while

extroverts like to discuss things in public.
 Intuitive people like to understand the big picture, while
sensing people need step-by-step details.
 Thinkers want to know the logic behind decisions, while
feeling people want to know how something affects
them personally.
 Judging people are driven to meet deadlines while
perceiving people need more help in developing and
following plans.
58

Other Communication Considerations
 Rarely does the receiver interpret a message exactly as

the sender intended.
 Geographic location and cultural background affect the

complexity of project communications.
 Different working hours
 Language barriers
 Different cultural norms

59

Determining the Number of
Communications Channels
 As the number of people involved increases, the

complexity of communications increases because there
are more communications channels or pathways
through which people can communicate.
 Number of communications channels = n(n-1)
2
where n is the number of people involved.

60

The Impact of the Number of People on
Communications Channels

61

Monitor Communications
⚫ Also performed throughout the project, this process

ensures that all of the communication techniques and
methods you’re using -- including the monitoring and
control measures you have in place -- follow the project
communication plan.

⚫ It’s also at this stage that you gauge whether or not your

approaches are producing the desired results. Otherwise,
you may have to make some adjustments in order to
prevent any communication issues from affecting the
project.
62

Monitor Communications (Cont)
Actions to carry out in this process include:
• Verify that communications go out as scheduled.
• Verify that the right stakeholders receive the right

communications.
• Verify that stakeholders understand the communications
they receive.
• Verify that relevant feedback or questions reach the right
people.

63

Monitor Communications (Cont)
Some of the project management documents you'll be
creating or updating include:
• Change requests
• Work performance reports
• Communication

management

and

stakeholder

engagement plans
• Other relevant project documents, such as the issue log
and the stakeholder register

How to be Successful at Project Communication
Management
⚫ From project initiation to closing, effective communication drives project
management. Creating a project proposal that will compel investors to act

favorably requires excellent communication skills. The same is true for:
• Negotiating contracts with vendors and suppliers
• Gathering the project’s requirements
• Interviewing stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations
• Planning the project
• Dividing the project into work packages
• Assigning tasks and responsibilities to team members
• Building a winning team
• Facilitating meetings
• Keeping track of the project’s progress
• Writing reports

66

How to be Successful at Project Communication
Management
⚫ And then there’s diversity in the workplace. Many of today’s project teams are
composed of diverse groups of people.
⚫ Even among small, local teams, communication challenges abound. You want
everyone on the same page. You want people with an interest in the project
to know what’s going on -- not just once, but on a regular basis.
⚫ You want everyone involved to understand the project’s priorities, as well as

the risks and opportunities it presents.
⚫ You want team members to feel accountable for their assigned roles and
responsibilities -- and to rally toward the same objectives. You want
stakeholders to support, instead of oppose, the project’s goals.
⚫ If opposition from stakeholders cannot be helped, though, you'll want to be
able to manage their influence on the project. At the same time, you have to
be respectful, receptive, and encouraging.
67
