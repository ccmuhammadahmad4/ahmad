Project 5: Cloud Migration Simulation

Tools:
- AWS
- Docker
- Terraform

Steps:
1. Choose a monolithic app (e.g., WordPress, Django).
2. Containerize the app using Docker.
3. Write Terraform code to provision EC2, RDS, and S3.
4. Deploy the containerized app to EC2 or ECS.
5. Configure security groups and IAM roles.
6. Test the application in the cloud.

Bonus:
- Document migration strategy (lift-and-shift, re-platform).
- Add monitoring and backups.
