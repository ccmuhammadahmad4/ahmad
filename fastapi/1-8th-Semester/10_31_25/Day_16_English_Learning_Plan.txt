Day 16 English Learning Plan for Muhammad Ahmad

1. Grammar Focus: Mixed Conditionals
--------------------------------------------------
🔹 Mixed conditionals combine second and third conditionals.
🔹 Use them to talk about past actions and their present consequences.

✅ Structure:
- If + past perfect, would + base verb
- If + simple past, would have + past participle

✅ Examples:
- If we had deployed the patch earlier, we wouldn't be facing this issue now.
- If the pipeline were stable, we wouldn't have missed the release deadline.

🎯 Practice:
Write 2 sentences using mixed conditionals related to your DevOps work.

2. Vocabulary Practice: DevOps Terms

Learn these 5 new words:
