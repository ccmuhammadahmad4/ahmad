Lecture 4: Varieties of Projects,
Life Cycle & Project Selection
Project Management (BCS Students)

Introduction
• Projects differ not only in sector (IT,
construction, R&D, etc.) but also in scale,
scope, and audience.
• Classification helps managers design
appropriate strategies, allocate resources, and
set realistic goals.
• We can classify projects into Personal, Local,
Organizational, National, and Global Projects.

Types of Project
A. Personal Project
• Definition: Small-scale, individual-driven
projects, often for self-improvement or
personal needs.
• Examples:Writing a thesis or dissertation.
• Learning a new programming language.
• Building a personal website or blog.
• Features: Limited scope, few resources, short
duration, personal benefit.

Types of Project
B. Local Project
• Definition: Projects carried out at the community or
city/town level.
• Examples: Setting up a public Park or library
• Local vaccination compaign.
• Roads repairs within a city.
• Features: Community-focused, often sponsored by
local governments or NGOs.
• Impact: Directly improves quality of life for residents.

Types of Project
C. Organizational Project
• Definition: Projects within a company, institution, or
NGO aimed at achieving organizational goals.
• Examples: Launching a new product
• Implementing an ERP system.
• Univerity developing a new Leaning Management
System (LMS).
• Features: Medium to large scope, managed
professionally, goal = organizational growth &
efficiency.

Types of Project
D. National Project
• Definition: Projects of national importance
undertaken by governments or state institutions.
• Examples: Construction of highways, airports, or
dams.
• National healthcare or education initiatives.
• CPEC projects in Pakistan.
• Features: Large budgets, long timelines, political
oversight, affects millions.

Types of Project
E. Global Project
• Definition: Projects that cross borders, involve
multiple countries, and address global needs.
• Examples: Climate change initiatives (Paris
Agreement projects).
• International space missions (NASA, ESA
collaborations).
• COVID-19 vaccine development and distribution.
• Features: Complex, high cost, multi-stakeholder,
requires global cooperation.
• Impact: Affects entire humanity, requires
international governance.

Life Cycle of a Project
• Initiation – Idea, feasibility.
• Planning – Budget, scheduling, resources.
• Execution – Actual work.
• Monitoring – Tracking, risk handling.
• Closure – Delivery, handover.

Why Project Selection is Important
• Ensures resources are used on the most
valuable projects.
• Aligns projects with strategic goals of the
organization.
• Reduces risk of project failure.
• Improves chances of achieving long-term
growth.

Project Selection Methods
• Non-Numeric Models – Based on judgment or
urgency.
• Numeric Models – Payback Period, NPV, IRR.
• Scoring Models – Weighted criteria like cost,
risk, benefit.
• Example: Choosing between LMS, mobile app,
or biometric system.

Project Selection Methods
A. Non-Numeric Models – (Qualitative)
• Based on judgment, experience or urgency.
• Example:
• “First Come, First Served”
• “Sacred Cow” (Top manager’s favorite project)
• “Urgency” (Disaster recovery projects like
flood relief).
• Pros: Quick and simple.
• Cons: Can be biased, lacks objectivity.

Project Selection Methods
B. Numeric Models – (Quantitative)
1. Payback Period (PP)
• Time required to recover initial investment.
• Example: Invest PKR 1 million → project
returns PKR 250k/year → Payback = 4 years.
• Shorter payback preferred.
2. Net Present Value (NPV)
• Calculates today’s value of future cash flows.
• Positive NPV = good

Project Selection Methods
B. Numeric Models – (Quantitative)
• Example: If NPV of IT portal = +500k PKR →
worth investing.
3. Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
• Discount rate at which NPV = 0.
• Higher IRR → better project.
C. Scoring/Ranking Models (Multi-Criteria)
• Assigns weights to criteria → scores projects
→ choose highest total.
• Example Criteria: Cost, Benefit, Risk, Strategic

Selection Matrix Example
• Criteria: Cost, Benefit, Risk, Strategic
Alignment.

Summary
• Projects come in many varieties (construction,
IT, social, economic).
• Life Cycle = Initiation → Planning → Execution
→ Monitoring → Closure.
• Selection uses non-numeric, numeric, and
scoring models.
• Right project = better use of resources and
strategic fit.
