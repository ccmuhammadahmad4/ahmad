│
├─── MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE
│    └─ No overlap between elements
│
├─── USE NOUNS (Deliverables)
│    ✅ "Requirements Document"
│    ❌ "Gather Requirements"
│
├─── 8/80 HOUR RULE

## 4. Developing a Manageable Project Schedule

### Question: How to develop a project schedule step-by-step?

**Answer Hierarchy:**

```
PROJECT SCHEDULING PROCESS - 7 STEPS
│
STEP 1: START WITH WBS
└─ List all work packages from WBS

STEP 2: DEFINE ACTIVITIES
├─ Convert deliverables to activities
├─ What ACTION creates each deliverable?
└─ Activity = VERB + NOUN
    Example:
    WBS: "Database Schema" (deliverable)
    Activity: "Design Database Schema" (action)

STEP 3: SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES
├─ Identify dependencies
│   ├─ Finish-to-Start (FS): A must finish before B starts
│   ├─ Start-to-Start (SS): A & B start together
│   ├─ Finish-to-Finish (FF): A & B finish together
│   └─ Start-to-Finish (SF): B can't finish until A starts
│
└─ Create network diagram

STEP 4: ESTIMATE DURATIONS
├─ Expert judgment
├─ Historical data
├─ Three-point estimation:
│   └─ (Optimistic + 4×Realistic + Pessimistic) ÷ 6
│
Example:
├─ Optimistic: 5 days
├─ Most likely: 10 days
├─ Pessimistic: 20 days
└─ Estimate: (5 + 40 + 20) ÷ 6 = 10.8 days

STEP 5: DETERMINE RESOURCE NEEDS
├─ Who will do each activity?
├─ What equipment needed?
├─ What materials needed?
└─ Check resource availability

STEP 6: DEVELOP SCHEDULE
├─ Use scheduling tool (MS Project, Gantt chart)
├─ Input activities, durations, dependencies
├─ Assign resources
├─ Identify critical path
│   └─ Longest path through network
│   └─ Activities with zero float
│   └─ Determines project duration
│
└─ Calculate float/slack
    └─ Float = Latest Start - Earliest Start

STEP 7: OPTIMIZE & BASELINE
├─ Check if meets deadline
├─ If too long:
│   ├─ Fast-track (parallel activities)
│   ├─ Crash (add resources)
│   └─ Reduce scope
├─ Get approval
└─ Baseline the schedule
```

### Critical Path Method (CPM):

```
CRITICAL PATH ANALYSIS
│
1. FORWARD PASS (Calculate Earliest Times)
   ├─ Start at beginning
   ├─ ES (Earliest Start) = EF of predecessor
   ├─ EF (Earliest Finish) = ES + Duration
   └─ At merge, ES = latest EF of predecessors

2. BACKWARD PASS (Calculate Latest Times)
   ├─ Start at end
   ├─ LF (Latest Finish) = LS of successor
   ├─ LS (Latest Start) = LF - Duration
   └─ At burst, LF = earliest LS of successors

3. CALCULATE FLOAT
   ├─ Total Float = LS - ES (or LF - EF)
   └─ Free Float = ES(successor) - EF(current)

4. IDENTIFY CRITICAL PATH
   ├─ Activities with zero float
   ├─ Forms continuous path
   └─ Longest path = Project duration

5. MANAGE CRITICAL PATH
   ├─ Monitor closely
   ├─ Delays here delay entire project
   └─ Focus resources here
```

### Gantt Chart Components:

```
GANTT CHART ELEMENTS
│
├─── TASK LIST (Left side)
│    └─ All activities listed
│
├─── TIMELINE (Top)
│    └─ Days/weeks/months
│
├─── BARS (Main area)
│    ├─ Start date
│    ├─ Duration (bar length)
│    └─ End date
│
├─── DEPENDENCIES (Arrows)
│    └─ Show task relationships
│
├─── MILESTONES (Diamonds)
│    └─ Key achievement points
│
├─── PROGRESS (Filled bars)
│    └─ % complete
│
└─── TODAY LINE (Vertical)
     └─ Current date marker
```

### Schedule Control:

KEEPING SCHEDULE ON TRACK
│
WEEKLY MONITORING:
├─ 1. Compare actual vs planned
├─ 2. Calculate variance
├─ 3. Update % complete
├─ 4. Check critical path
└─ 5. Take corrective action if needed

IF BEHIND SCHEDULE:
├─ Option 1: FAST-TRACK
│   ├─ Do activities in parallel
│   └─ Increases risk
│
├─ Option 2: CRASH
│   ├─ Add more resources
│   └─ Increases cost
│
├─ Option 3: REDUCE SCOPE
│   └─ Remove non-critical features

## 6. Financial Metrics for Project Evaluation

### Question: How to calculate and interpret financial metrics?

**Answer Hierarchy:**

```
FINANCIAL METRICS GUIDE
│
METRIC 1: PAYBACK PERIOD
├─ Formula: Investment ÷ Annual Cash Flow
├─ Meaning: How long to recover investment?
├─ Decision: Shorter = Better
└─ Example:
    Investment: Rs. 500,000
    Annual benefit: Rs. 125,000
    Payback: 500,000 ÷ 125,000 = 4 years

METRIC 2: NPV (Net Present Value)
├─ Formula: Σ [Cash Flow ÷ (1+r)^t] - Investment
│   Where:
│   r = discount rate (required rate of return)
│   t = time period (year)
│
├─ Decision:
│   ├─ NPV > 0 → ACCEPT (creates value)
│   ├─ NPV = 0 → Breakeven
│   └─ NPV < 0 → REJECT (destroys value)
│
└─ Example:
    Investment: Rs. 100,000 (Year 0)
    Cash flows: Rs. 30,000/year for 5 years
    Discount rate: 10%
    
    NPV = [30,000÷1.1 + 30,000÷1.21 + 30,000÷1.331 
           + 30,000÷1.464 + 30,000÷1.61] - 100,000
        = [27,273 + 24,793 + 22,539 + 20,490 + 18,628] - 100,000
        = 113,723 - 100,000
        = Rs. 13,723 → ACCEPT ✅

METRIC 3: IRR (Internal Rate of Return)
├─ Meaning: The discount rate at which NPV = 0
├─ Decision:
│   ├─ IRR > Required rate → ACCEPT
│   └─ IRR < Required rate → REJECT
│
└─ Example:
    If IRR = 15% and required rate = 10%
    → ACCEPT (earning 15% > 10% required)

METRIC 4: BCR (Benefit-Cost Ratio)
├─ Formula: PV of Benefits ÷ PV of Costs
├─ Decision:
│   ├─ BCR > 1 → Benefits exceed costs → ACCEPT
│   ├─ BCR = 1 → Breakeven
│   └─ BCR < 1 → Costs exceed benefits → REJECT
│
└─ Example:
    PV Benefits: Rs. 150,000
    PV Costs: Rs. 100,000
    BCR: 150,000 ÷ 100,000 = 1.5
    → For every Rs. 1 spent, get Rs. 1.5 back → ACCEPT ✅

METRIC 5: DCF (Discounted Cash Flow)
├─ Formula: Cash Flow ÷ (1 + r)^t
├─ Purpose: Convert future money to today's value
└─ Used in NPV calculation

METRIC 6: OPPORTUNITY COST
├─ Definition: Value of next best alternative
├─ Not a formula, but a concept
└─ Example:
    If select Project A, lose Project B
    Opportunity cost = NPV of Project B
```

### Decision Matrix:

```
WHEN TO USE WHICH METRIC?

SITUATION 1: Limited budget, need quick return
└─ Use: PAYBACK PERIOD (shortest wins)

SITUATION 2: Long-term value creation
└─ Use: NPV (highest NPV wins)

SITUATION 3: Comparing projects of different sizes
└─ Use: IRR or BCR (percentage/ratio, not absolute)

SITUATION 4: Must consider time value of money
└─ Use: NPV, IRR, BCR (all use discounting)

SITUATION 5: Simple, quick decision needed
└─ Use: PAYBACK PERIOD (easiest to calculate)

BEST PRACTICE:
└─ Use MULTIPLE metrics together for robust decision
```

## 9. Communication Management Planning

### Question: How to create a communication management plan?

**Answer Hierarchy:**

```
COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT PLAN - 7 STEPS
│
STEP 1: IDENTIFY STAKEHOLDERS
├─ List everyone affected by project
├─ Categorize by:
│   ├─ Power (High/Low)
│   ├─ Interest (High/Low)
│   └─ Influence (High/Med/Low)
│
└─ Prioritize:
    ├─ High Power, High Interest → Manage Closely
    ├─ High Power, Low Interest → Keep Satisfied
    ├─ Low Power, High Interest → Keep Informed
    └─ Low Power, Low Interest → Monitor

STEP 2: ANALYZE COMMUNICATION NEEDS
For each stakeholder:
├─ What information do they need?
│   ├─ High-level summary or details?
│   └─ What topics?
├─ How often?
│   └─ Daily, weekly, monthly?
├─ Preferred format?
│   └─ Email, meeting, report, dashboard?
└─ Delivery method?
    └─ Push or pull?

STEP 3: DETERMINE COMMUNICATION CHANNELS
├─ Calculate complexity: n(n-1) ÷ 2
│   Examples:
│   ├─ 5 people = 10 channels
│   ├─ 10 people = 45 channels
│   └─ 20 people = 190 channels
│
└─ Minimize channels by grouping stakeholders

STEP 4: SELECT COMMUNICATION METHODS
├─ FACE-TO-FACE
│   ├─ Best for: Complex, sensitive topics
│   ├─ Effectiveness: 100% (58% body + 35% tone + 7% words)
│   └─ Use for: Kickoff, critical decisions, conflicts
│
├─ MEETINGS
│   ├─ Best for: Collaboration, brainstorming
│   └─ Use for: Planning, reviews, standups
│
├─ EMAIL
│   ├─ Best for: Formal, documented communication
│   └─ Use for: Status reports, approvals, announcements
│
├─ INSTANT MESSAGING
│   ├─ Best for: Quick questions, informal
│   └─ Use for: Daily coordination
│
├─ REPORTS
│   ├─ Best for: Status updates, formal documentation
│   └─ Use for: Weekly/monthly updates
│
└─ PRESENTATIONS
    ├─ Best for: Stakeholder updates, approvals
    └─ Use for: Executive briefings, phase reviews

STEP 5: CREATE COMMUNICATION MATRIX
```

**Communication Matrix Template:**

| Stakeholder/Group | Info Needed | Frequency | Method | Format | Owner | Timing |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|---------|---------|-------|---------|
| Project Sponsor | Status, budget variance, major issues | Weekly | Email report | PDF | PM | Monday 9 AM |
| Steering Committee | Progress, risks, decisions needed | Monthly | Presentation | PowerPoint | PM | Last Friday |
| Project Team | Tasks, blockers, priorities | Daily | Standup meeting | Face-to-face | PM | 9:30 AM |
| Client | Deliverables, progress, changes | Bi-weekly | Meeting | Demo + Report | PM | Every other Friday |
| End Users | Training, features, support | As needed | Email + Training | Guides, Videos | Training Lead | Before launch |
| Vendors | Requirements, POs, invoices | As needed | Email | Documents | Procurement | As required |

```
STEP 6: PLAN MEETINGS
For each recurring meeting:
├─ Purpose
├─ Attendees
├─ Frequency
├─ Duration
├─ Agenda
└─ Action items process

Example: Daily Standup
├─ Purpose: Sync team, identify blockers
├─ Attendees: Core team
├─ Frequency: Daily
├─ Duration: 15 minutes
├─ Agenda:
│   ├─ What did you complete yesterday?
│   ├─ What will you do today?
│   └─ Any blockers?
└─ Stand up (no sitting = stays short)

STEP 7: DEFINE ESCALATION PROCESS
├─ Level 1: Team Member → Project Manager
├─ Level 2: Project Manager → Sponsor
├─ Level 3: Sponsor → Steering Committee
└─ Escalation criteria defined
```

### Communication Barriers & Solutions:

```
BARRIERS:
├─ Physical (distance, noise)
├─ Language (jargon, translation)
├─ Emotional (ego, fear, anger)
├─ Perceptual (assumptions, biases)
├─ Cultural (different norms)
├─ Organizational (hierarchy, silos)
└─ Technology (poor tools)

SOLUTIONS:
├─ Active listening
├─ Simple, clear language
├─ Verify understanding (repeat back)
├─ Multiple channels
├─ Cultural awareness training
├─ Encourage openness
├─ Reduce distractions
└─ Appropriate technology
```

### Monitor Communications:

```
MONITORING PROCESS:
│
WEEKLY CHECK:
├─ Were all communications sent on schedule?
├─ Did right people receive info?
├─ Was information understood?
├─ Any communication breakdowns?
└─ Stakeholder satisfaction with communication?

METRICS:
├─ % of stakeholders satisfied with communication
├─ Number of communication-related issues
├─ Response time to queries
└─ Meeting attendance rate

ADJUST:
└─ Update communication plan based on feedback
```

## 10. Risk Management Process

### Question: How to identify and manage project risks?

**Answer Hierarchy:**

```
RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS - 6 STEPS
│
STEP 1: PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT
├─ Define risk management approach
├─ Assign roles & responsibilities
├─ Define risk categories
└─ Create risk register template

STEP 2: IDENTIFY RISKS
Methods:
├─ Brainstorming (team session)
├─ Interviews (experts, stakeholders)
├─ Checklist (from past projects)
├─ SWOT Analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)
├─ Assumptions analysis
└─ Document review

Common Risk Categories:
├─ Technical risks (technology, complexity)
├─ Schedule risks (dependencies, estimates)
├─ Cost risks (budget, funding)
├─ Resource risks (availability, skills)
├─ External risks (market, regulations)
├─ Organizational risks (priorities, structure)
└─ Project management risks (communication, planning)

Document Each Risk:
├─ Risk ID
├─ Risk description (What can go wrong?)
├─ Cause (Why might it happen?)
├─ Impact (What happens if it occurs?)
└─ Category

STEP 3: ANALYZE RISKS (Qualitative)
For each risk, assess:
├─ PROBABILITY (Likelihood)
│   ├─ Very High: >70%
│   ├─ High: 50-70%
│   ├─ Medium: 30-50%
│   ├─ Low: 10-30%
│   └─ Very Low: <10%
│
└─ IMPACT (Severity)
    ├─ Very High: Project failure
    ├─ High: Major delay/cost
    ├─ Medium: Moderate impact
    ├─ Low: Minor impact
    └─ Very Low: Negligible

Risk Score = Probability × Impact

Risk Priority Matrix:
                Impact →
         VL   L    M    H   VH
    VH   M    H    H   VH   VH
    H    L    M    H    H   VH
P   M    L    L    M    H    H
↓   L   VL    L    L    M    H
    VL  VL   VL    L    L    M

Priority:
├─ VH (Very High) → Immediate action
├─ H (High) → Action required
├─ M (Medium) → Monitor closely
└─ L/VL (Low) → Watch

STEP 4: ANALYZE RISKS (Quantitative - Optional)
For major risks:
├─ Expected Monetary Value (EMV)
│   └─ EMV = Probability × Financial Impact
│
├─ Decision Tree Analysis
├─ Monte Carlo Simulation
└─ Sensitivity Analysis

STEP 5: PLAN RISK RESPONSES
For each high/very high risk, choose strategy:

NEGATIVE RISKS (Threats):
├─ AVOID
│   ├─ Change plan to eliminate risk
│   └─ Example: Use proven tech instead of new tech
│
├─ MITIGATE
│   ├─ Reduce probability or impact
│   └─ Example: Add buffer time, hire expert
│
├─ TRANSFER
│   ├─ Shift risk to third party
│   └─ Example: Insurance, outsourcing, fixed-price contract
│
└─ ACCEPT
    ├─ Do nothing (risk too small or unavoidable)
    ├─ Active: Set aside contingency reserve
    └─ Passive: Deal with it if it happens

POSITIVE RISKS (Opportunities):
├─ EXPLOIT
│   └─ Ensure opportunity happens
├─ ENHANCE
│   └─ Increase probability/impact
├─ SHARE
│   └─ Partner to realize opportunity
└─ ACCEPT
    └─ Take advantage if it occurs

Document:
├─ Risk owner (Who manages this risk?)
├─ Response strategy
├─ Action plan
├─ Contingency plan (if risk occurs)
├─ Budget for response
└─ Timeline

STEP 6: MONITOR & CONTROL RISKS
├─ Track identified risks
├─ Identify new risks (ongoing)
├─ Review risk status (weekly/monthly)
├─ Execute response plans
├─ Evaluate effectiveness
└─ Update risk register

Risk Review Meeting (Monthly):
├─ Status of existing risks
├─ New risks identified
├─ Risks that materialized
├─ Response effectiveness
└─ Risk trends
```
