DOCKERFILE INSTRUCTIONS CHEAT SHEET
==============================

1. FROM
   - Description: Specifies the base image.
   - Use Case: Start building from an existing image.
   - Syntax: FROM <image>
   - Example: FROM ubuntu:20.04

2. RUN
   - Description: Executes commands during image build.
   - Use Case: Install packages or configure system.
   - Syntax: RUN <command>
   - Example: RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx

3. CMD
   - Description: Default command to run when container starts.
   - Use Case: Set default behavior.
   - Syntax: CMD ["executable", "param1", "param2"]
   - Example: CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

4. ENTRYPOINT
   - Description: Configures a container to run as an executable.
   - Use Case: Always run a specific command.
   - Syntax: ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param"]
   - Example: ENTRYPOINT ["python3", "app.py"]

5. COPY
   - Description: Copies files from host to image.
   - Use Case: Add source code or config files.
   - Syntax: COPY <src> <dest>
   - Example: COPY . /app

6. ADD
   - Description: Like COPY but supports URLs and archives.
   - Use Case: Add remote files or extract archives.
   - Syntax: ADD <src> <dest>
   - Example: ADD app.tar.gz /app

7. WORKDIR
   - Description: Sets working directory for following instructions.
   - Use Case: Avoid repeated path usage.
   - Syntax: WORKDIR <path>
   - Example: WORKDIR /app

8. EXPOSE
   - Description: Documents the port the container listens on.
   - Use Case: Inform Docker about network usage.
   - Syntax: EXPOSE <port>
   - Example: EXPOSE 80

9. ENV
   - Description: Sets environment variables.
   - Use Case: Configure runtime settings.
   - Syntax: ENV <key>=<value>
   - Example: ENV NODE_ENV=production

10. VOLUME
    - Description: Creates mount point for external volume.
    - Use Case: Persist data.
    - Syntax: VOLUME ["<path>"]
    - Example: VOLUME ["/data"]

11. LABEL
    - Description: Adds metadata to image.
    - Use Case: Versioning, authorship.
    - Syntax: LABEL <key>=<value>
    - Example: LABEL maintainer="ahmad@example.com"

12. USER
    - Description: Sets user to run container.
    - Use Case: Security best practice.
    - Syntax: USER <username>
    - Example: USER nginx

13. ARG
    - Description: Defines build-time variables.
    - Use Case: Parameterize builds.
    - Syntax: ARG <name>
    - Example: ARG VERSION=1.0

14. SHELL
    - Description: Changes default shell used in RUN.
    - Use Case: Use different shell.
    - Syntax: SHELL ["executable", "param"]
    - Example: SHELL ["powershell", "-command"]

==============================
INTERVIEW QUESTIONS: DOCKERFILE
==============================

Q1: What is the difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT in a Dockerfile?
Answer: CMD sets default arguments for the container, while ENTRYPOINT defines the executable. ENTRYPOINT always runs, CMD can be overridden.
Explanation: Shows understanding of container behavior and Dockerfile execution flow.

---

Q2: Why would you use ARG instead of ENV in a Dockerfile?
Answer: ARG is used for build-time variables, while ENV is for runtime. ARG values are not available after the image is built.
Explanation: Demonstrates knowledge of build vs runtime configuration.

---

Q3: How can you reduce the number of layers in a Docker image?
Answer: Combine commands using `&&` in a single RUN instruction, and avoid unnecessary instructions like multiple COPYs.
Explanation: Shows optimization skills and understanding of Docker layering.

---

Q4: What is the purpose of the WORKDIR instruction?
Answer: WORKDIR sets the working directory for subsequent instructions. It avoids hardcoding paths repeatedly.
Explanation: Indicates clean and maintainable Dockerfile practices.

---

Q5: How do COPY and ADD differ in Dockerfile?
Answer: COPY is for local files only. ADD supports remote URLs and auto-extracts archives.
Explanation: Shows awareness of subtle differences and when to use each.

---

Q6: How would you pass a build-time variable to a Dockerfile?
Answer: Use ARG in the Dockerfile and pass it via `--build-arg` during `docker build`.
Explanation: Demonstrates practical knowledge of parameterized builds.

---

Q7: What are best practices for writing secure Dockerfiles?
Answer:
- Use minimal base images (e.g., Alpine)
- Avoid running as root (use USER)
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Avoid hardcoded secrets
Explanation: Shows security awareness and production-readiness.

---

Q8: How do you persist data generated by a container?
Answer: Use VOLUME instruction to define mount points, or bind mounts during `docker run`.
Explanation: Demonstrates understanding of data persistence in containers.

---

Q9: What happens if both CMD and ENTRYPOINT are defined?
Answer: ENTRYPOINT takes precedence. CMD provides default arguments to ENTRYPOINT.
Explanation: Shows deep understanding of Dockerfile execution order.

---

Q10: How would you troubleshoot a Dockerfile that fails during build?
Answer: Use `docker build` with `--no-cache` and `--progress=plain`, check each layer’s output, and isolate failing RUN commands.
Explanation: Demonstrates debugging skills and Dockerfile fluency.

Would you like me to generate this as a downloadable `.txt` file next?

Also, I can do the same for **Kubernetes YAML**, **Terraform `.tf` files**, or **CI/CD pipelines** if you're preparing for interviews or building your DevOps toolkit.
