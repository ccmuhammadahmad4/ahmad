Work Breakdown
Structure

What is WBS (Work Breakdown Structure)?
• As per PMBOK the work breakdown structure is:
“A deliverable-oriented hierarchical decomposition of the work to
be executed by the project team to accomplish the project
objectives and create the required deliverables”.
“A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical structure of
things that the project will make or outcomes that it will deliver”

What is WBS (Work Breakdown Structure)?
• In simple words:
“A work breakdown structure defines all the things a project needs
to accomplish, organized into multiple levels, and displayed
graphically.”

• Essentially, the WBS defines the “what” of the project. Everything you
need to accomplish in the project is displayed in a single, easy-tounderstand chart. The purpose of this chart is to break down complex
activities into smaller, more management constituents.

WBS example for an Aircraft System
• Developing an aircraft system is obviously a very complex endeavor. You need an
aircraft (which itself is an extremely complex undertaking), a system to train staff
and pilots, a way to manage infrastructure, etc.
• Its WBS breaks down all these complex activities into smaller, more management
constituent parts.
• Thus, there might have one group responsible for building an aircraft. Within this
group, there might have one team focused on building the airframe, another on
creating a propulsion system, and so on.
• It’s common to have three levels of decomposition in the WBS. One might have a
fourth and even a fifth level in case of extremely complex projects. For most
projects, however, three levels will be sufficient.

WBS example for making a Bicycle

• The numbers next to each item indicate the number of hours or resources required to
complete the work. The sum of all these must be 100 at each level.
• This is called “100% rule” - that the sum of the work at each “child” level must be
100% of the work at the “parent” level.
• The WBS doesn’t describe any actions. Instead, every item is a noun describing an end
product - a bicycle seat, fork, handlebar, etc.
• This is one of the fundamental features of a WBS: it describes deliverables, not the
activities necessary to get there. Every item in the WBS must correspond to an end
product (real or virtual). If there are any verbs in WBS, then one is doing something
wrong.
• For example, if one is creating a work breakdown structure for manufacturing a car,
he/she’ll include items such as “car body” (a deliverable), not “welding steel” (an
activity).

Relevant Definitions
• Work: work refers to “work products or deliverables that are the
result of effort
and not the effort itself”. That is, “work” defines the end result of any
activity.
The work remains constant even though the amount of effort needed to get
there might inflate/deflate.
• Deliverable: A deliverable is “any unique and verifiable product, result, or capability to
perform a service that is required to be produced to complete a process phase, or
project”. Deliverables will vary from project to project and client to client.
• Work package: According to PERT (which developed the WBS), a work package is “the
work required to complete a specific job or process, such as a report, a design, a
documentation requirement or portion thereof, a piece of hardware, or a
services., a simpler definition: “a work package is a deliverable at the lowest level of
the WBS.”
For example, if one is making a bicycle, a “bike seat” might be one of his deliverables.
All the work required to create the seat - cutting leather, shaping foam, creating metal
frame, etc. - would be part of the work package.

Characteristics of the Work Breakdown Structure
Not every breakdown of project deliverables can be classified as a WBS. For it to be
called a work breakdown structure, it must have certain characteristics:

• Hierarchy: The WBS is hierarchical in nature. Each “child” level exists in a strict
hierarchical relationship with the parent level. The sum of all the child elements
should give you the parent element.
• 100% rule: Every level of decomposition must make up 100% of the parent level. It
should also have at least two child elements.
• Mutually exclusive: All elements at a particular level in a WBS must be mutually
exclusive. There must be no overlap in either their deliverables or their work. This is
meant to reduce miscommunication and duplicate work.
• Outcome-focused: The WBS must focus on the result of work, i.e. deliverables,
rather than the activities necessary to get there. Every element should be described
via nouns, not verbs. This is a big source of confusion for beginners to WBS.

Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Examples
• The best way to understand how work breakdown structures work is by looking at
different WBS examples. Seeing how complex projects are actually broken down can help
you do the same in your projects.
• While work breakdown structures are technically supposed to focus on deliverables, not
activities (i.e. nouns, not verbs), plenty of project managers skip this rule in actual
projects. Which is why one’ll see WBS examples where top-level “deliverables” actually
describe activities.
• This isn’t ideal, but keep in mind that people use work breakdown structure for all sorts
of things, even outside of project management - writing a book, planning a vacation, etc.
If one is using it casually, he/she don’t really have to follow all the hard rules.

• On that note, let’s look at some work breakdown structure examples.

A Casual WBS Example
• The convenient format of the WBS means that one can use it for any number of
purposes, including managing casual projects.
• In such cases, don’t really have to follow the formal guidelines of a work
breakdown structure. Rather, the goal should be to create natural categories and
sub-categories. The only restriction, They should all add up to 100% of the work
to be done.

A Casual WBS Example (Cont)

A Casual WBS Example (Cont)
• Note that the WBS lists activities (“cut lawn”) instead of
deliverables. This wouldn’t pass muster in a formal work
breakdown structure, but if one is using something
internally, it doesn’t really matter as long as each level makes
sense.

Computer Program WBS Example
• WBS example, one can see one of the biggest mistakes people
make when creating the WBS: mistaking activities for deliverables.
• As one can see, the third-level in the WBS identifies activities such as
“develop business case” or “perform primary planning”.
• This is extra within the context of a WBS. If one remove the verb from
each of these WBS levels, he/she’d get a deliverable (i.e. a noun), not
an activity. That is, one don’t need “develop business case” - just
“business case” is enough.
• When to create work breakdown structures, there is need to
remove verbs from each WBS level. One is, after all, describing
things that need to be delivered, not the tasks necessary to deliver
them.

WBS vs Project Schedule vs Project Plan
• Common source of confusion for beginners is the difference
between the work breakdown
structure, project schedule, and project plan.
• While these three things often describe the same thing - what is to
be achieved in the project - they vary greatly in scope and details.
• Work breakdown structure describes the deliverables needed to
complete the project, i.e. the “what” of the project. It doesn’t
include timelines or resources. The goal of the WBS is to give the project
team a hyper-focused idea of what they need to achieve.

WBS vs Project Schedule vs Project Plan
• Project schedule describes the project’s deliverables as well as
their deadlines and resource
requirements. Think of it as the “what”, “when”, and “who” of the
project.
• Project plan is an expansive document covering virtually every
aspect of the project and its
management.
It
includes
details on how the project will be executed, managed, and
controlled. It usually has several constituent plans governing
communications, risk management, change management, etc.
• In terms of the level of detail, you can think of the project plan as
the broadest, followed by the project schedule, and finally, the work
breakdown structure.

Benefits of a WBS
The WBS is a laser-focused breakdown of all the key deliverables needed to make
the project successful. Creating one offers several advantages, such as:
• Project schedule: The WBS is the foundation of the project schedule and budget.
Once you know all the deliverables required to complete the project, as well as
their hierarchical relationships, it will be much easier to assign resources and set
deadlines.
• Accountability: Since all elements in a WBS are mutually exclusive, it helps create
accountability. A team assigned to a single work package is wholly accountable
for its completion. This reduces overlaps in responsibility.

Benefits of a WBS (Cont)
• Commitment: The WBS gives teams a very high-level overview of their responsibilities.
Since each team is responsible for a specific component at a time, it helps make them
more committed to completing their assigned tasks.
• Reduces ambiguities: The process of developing the WBS involves the project manager,
project team, and all relevant stakeholders. This encourages dialog and helps everyone
involved flesh out their responsibilities. Thus, everyone has less ambiguity and a better
idea of what they're supposed to do.
Creating a WBS is the first step in developing a comprehensive project schedule. It can be
of massive help in getting everyone to understand the project’s scope and deliverables at
different levels.

WBS in Project Management
• The work breakdown structure springs from the project charter. Ideally, the highlevel deliverables in the WBS should match, word for word, the goals and
deliverables listed in the project scope statement.
• Consequently, the WBS is one of the first documents created in the project
management lifecycle. One’ll create it before he/she create the Gantt chart or the
project plan.
• Which is to say, the WBS is often the first deliverable in a project.
• While the stated benefit of a WBS is in helping one keep track of deliverables and
managing project scope, it has another key use in project management: creating
the project schedule.

WBS in Project Management (Cont)
• Understanding the deliverables included in a WBS and mapping their
relationships is crucial for charting a project schedule. Within this process, one
first creates a WBS dictionary (i.e. list of deliverables), turns these deliverables
into a map of relationships (i.e. a network diagram) and uses it to create the
schedule.

• One can also use the map of deliverables (and the relationships between
them) in a WBS to figure out the resources to be used in their creation. This is
called a Resource Breakdown Structure (RBS).

WBS in Project Management (Cont)
• A resource breakdown structure consists of both the material and human
resources required to complete a deliverable. For example, if you’re creating a
chair as part of a larger house remodeling project, you’ll need:
• A carpenter
• Raw materials such as wood, polish, nails, glue, etc.
• Tools such as hammers, saws, drills, etc.

WBS in Project Management (Cont)
• One can represent these resources as under:

• Once one understand how resources will be used to create each deliverable,
he/she can also improve his/her project scheduling - one of the many ways a
work breakdown structure finds use in project management.

Creating WBS
• The output of the WBS development process might seem simple: a short
document with a list of deliverables. To create it, however, one needs a thorough
understanding of the project’s scope, his/her team’s capabilities, and his/her
stakeholders’ requirements.
• Process for creating a WBS from scratch consists of following steps:
1. Understand the Project’s Scope
2. Determine Major Deliverables
3. Determine Work Packages
4. Create a WBS Dictionary
5. Use the Right WBS Format

Steps in Creating WBS
1. Understand the Project’s Scope
• WBS is one of the key documents created at the end of the ‘Planning’ phase.

• Before one can create it, however, one needs a thorough understanding of the project’s scope and objectives.
• Mainly, one needs two things:
• Project scope statement to understand the project’s scope in detail.
• Project scope management plan to understand how to deal with changes to the project’s scope (which will
affect your deliverables).
• One’ll want to refer to his/her project charter to develop the scope statement and scope management plan.
• The output of the entire WBS development process is as follows:
• Work breakdown structure
• WBS dictionary
• Scope baseline

Steps in Creating WBS
2. Determine Major Deliverables
• After having understanding of the project scope, start the WBS development process by
figuring out the key deliverables.
• For example, if one goal is to “build a house”, he/she might have the following three broad
deliverables at Level 2:

• There are two heuristics you can follow for determining major deliverables at the 2nd level:
• Each deliverable must be essential to the success of the project. For example, you can’t build a house
without a foundation, exterior, or interior.
• Each deliverable should be the responsibility of an independent team. In the above example, the team
responsible for laying the foundation won’t be the same as the team building the interiors.

Steps in Creating WBS
3. Determine Work Packages
• A work package is a deliverable at the lowest level of a WBS.

• In a typical 3-level WBS, determining work packages would be the next step after identifying major deliverables.
• This is one of the most important parts of the WBS development process and one that will require extensive input from
project team and stakeholders.
• Goal is to pick a major deliverable, then identify all the work necessary to complete it. This work package must be:
• Independent: The work package must be mutually exclusive and have no dependence on other ongoing elements.
• Definable: The work package should have a definite beginning and end, and should be understood by all project
participants.
• Estimable: You should be able to estimate the work package's duration and resource requirements.
• Manageable: The package must represent a "meaningful unit of work", i.e. it must accomplish something
concrete, and can be assigned to an individual or team. It should also be measurable.
• Integratable: The package must integrate with other elements to create the parent level.
• Adaptable: Ideally, the package must be able to accommodate changes in scope as per the project's requirements.

Steps in Creating WBS
3. Determine Work Packages (Cont)
• In case the work can’t meet the above requirements, you can decompose the WBS into another level.
There are a few heuristics you can follow for determining work packages:
• 8/80 rule: A common rule of the thumb is that each work package must be no longer than 80
hours and no less than 8 hours in total length. If it is longer, decompose it further. If it is shorter,
think of going up by one level.
• Reporting period: Another common rule is to limit each work package to a single reporting
period. If it takes longer than one reporting period (monthly, weekly, etc.), to accomplish,
decompose it further.
• Use nouns: You should be able to describe each work package with a noun or an adjective. To
break it down further, you’ll need to use verbs. For example, “bike seat” is a noun describing a
work package. If you break it down further, you’ll need to use verbs like
“cut foam”, “stitch leather”, etc.

Steps in Creating WBS
4. Create a WBS Dictionary
• The WBS dictionary is a document that outlines the definition and scope of each element contained in the
WBS. It is a supporting document meant to help incoming project teams understand each work package
better.
• You don't necessarily need a WBS dictionary, especially if the project is simple or limited in scope. For
complex projects with a lot of churn, however, the dictionary can greatly improve clarity.
• Further, the WBS dictionary takes you one step closer to creating the project schedule. You can often
transplant details from this dictionary straight to your project scheduling tool.
• Here are a few details you can include for each item in the WBS dictionary:
• Work package ID (see the ID convention below)
• Work package name
• Work package description
• Assigned to (individual or team name)
• Department
• Date of assignment
• Due date
• Estimated cost

Steps in Creating WBS
4. Create a WBS Dictionary (Cont)
• The level of detail one want to include is entirely up to him/her.
• Here's an example of a more simplified WBS dictionary with element ID, name, and description:

• A WBS dictionary helps project team members understand each element

Steps in Creating WBS
5. Use the Right WBS Format
• Once one has all the work packages and WBS dictionary, it’s time to create the WBS.
• There are several WBS formats one can follow. The simplest way to do this is to
create text-based hierarchical groupings. By convention, one use numbers and
decimal points to indicate the level of the element.
• For example, the number 1.1.1.3 means that you’re referencing the 3rd element of
the 4th level of the WBS.

Steps in Creating WBS
5. Use the Right WBS Format (Cont)
Thus, one might have a text-based WBS as under:

Key WBS Best Practices
• The work breakdown structure is the foundation of project schedule, which, in turn,
is the foundation of the entire project.

• Following a few best practices in the WBS creation phase can greatly improve the
accuracy of project schedule. A clear breakdown of key deliverables will help to
estimate and assign resources better.
• Here are some key best practices one should follow when creating a work
breakdown structure:
1. Use Nouns, Not Verbs
2. Follow the 100% Rule Closely
3. Keep All Elements Mutually Exclusive
4. Mind the Level of Detail
5. Use a Project Management Software

Key WBS Best Practices
1. Use Nouns, Not Verbs
• The purpose of a WBS is to track deliverables, not activities. The "what" of the work
matters, not the "how" of getting there.

• One way to achieve this goal is to use nouns when adding elements to the WBS. That
is, every element in the WBS should be either a noun or an adjective.
• Think of "House foundation" instead of "Removing earth to create the foundation",
or "Communication plan document" instead of "Gathering requirements for
communication plan".
• The goal of this "nouns, not verbs" exercise is to force one to keep his/her elements
broad in scope. Activities usually describe the final level in any work package. WBS
should focus on one level above that.

Key WBS Best Practices
2. Follow the 100% Rule Closely
• A work breakdown structure is meant to be exhaustive. There should be no
deliverable outside of the WBS.
• This is why it is crucial that one should follow the 100% rule. Every level should be
everything one needs to deliver. Anything beyond that should be scrapped.
• This helps to spot gaps and redundancies. It also ensures that every project
component is complete and nothing is left behind.

Key WBS Best Practices
3. Keep All Elements Mutually Exclusive
• The other cardinal rule of work breakdown structures - besides the 100% rule - is
"mutual exclusivity". Every element should be independent. One shouldn't need any
input from any other element to complete it. If one do, it's better to combine the
two elements together and push the work package up a level.
• For example, if one is making a bicycle, he/she can create a "handlebar"
independently of the "bicycle frame". Thus, it would be a separate work package.
• In contrast, to create the "wheel spokes", one first needs to have the exact
dimensions of the wheel rim. In such a case, it would be better to combine "wheel
spokes" and "wheel rim" into a single work package.

Key WBS Best Practices
4. Mind the Level of Detail
• A common mistake when creating work breakdown structures is to keep the level of
detail either too broad (i.e. too few levels) or too narrow (i.e. too many levels).

• Ideally, the decomposition should stop before one can use verbs to describe the
element. For instance, if one is making a bicycle, "wheel rim" should be the final
level since it describes a deliverable. If one decomposes further, he/she'll have
activities related to the deliverable such as "buy steel", "shape steel", "make holes
for wheel spokes", etc.
• If this happens, one knows he/she has got too many levels.
• Aim for between 3-5 levels. Any further than that and one is looking at a project
that's likely too complex (and might be better as a program).

Key WBS Best Practices
5. Use a Project Management Software
• One of the best tips about WBS is to “use a template”.
• One might use a simple Word template, or one might use something offered by
his/her flow chart tool. But if one wants the WBS to integrate with the rest of his/her
project documents, the best source of templates is his/her project management
software.
• Most PM tools have built-in capabilities to create a work breakdown structure from
scratch. One can simply specify his/her level of detail and add element data to create
a WBS quickly.
• The best part about using a PM tool is that one’s WBS data is available to him/her
when he/she is creating project schedule.
• If one follows these guidelines, he/she’ll have a highly effective work breakdown
structure that will help him/her in every phase of project planning.
