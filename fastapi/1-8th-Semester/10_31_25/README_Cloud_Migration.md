# Cloud Migration Simulation

## Project Overview
This project simulates migrating a monolithic application to AWS cloud using Docker containers and Terraform for infrastructure provisioning.

## Tools Used
- AWS
- Docker
- Terraform

## Setup Instructions
1. Containerize the monolithic app using Docker
2. Install Terraform and configure AWS credentials
3. Create Git repository for migration scripts

## Implementation Steps
- Provision AWS infrastructure using Terraform
- Deploy Docker container to EC2 or ECS
- Configure networking and security groups
- Document migration strategy (lift-and-shift, re-platform)

## Bonus Tasks
- Use CloudWatch for monitoring
- Implement CI/CD for cloud deployment
- Compare cost and performance before/after migration
