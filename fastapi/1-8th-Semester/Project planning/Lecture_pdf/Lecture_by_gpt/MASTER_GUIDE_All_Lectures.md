## Lecture 10: Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

### 🎯 Core Concepts
**WBS Definition**: "Hierarchical decomposition of project work into deliverables"
- Describes WHAT needs to be done (deliverables, not activities)
- Uses NOUNS, not VERBS
- Follows 100% rule (all children = 100% of parent)
- Elements are mutually exclusive

**Key Characteristics:**
1. Hierarchy
2. 100% Rule
3. Mutually Exclusive
4. Outcome-Focused

### 📊 Problem-Solving Hierarchy

**5-Step WBS Creation:**
```
STEP 1: UNDERSTAND PROJECT SCOPE
└─ Read project charter
└─ Review scope statement
└─ Understand objectives clearly

STEP 2: DETERMINE MAJOR DELIVERABLES (Level 2)
└─ Break project into 3-7 major components
└─ Each must be:
    ├─ Essential to project success
    ├─ Assigned to independent team
    └─ Substantial work package
    
Example: Building House
├─ Foundation
├─ Structure
├─ Exterior
├─ Interior
└─ Systems

STEP 3: DETERMINE WORK PACKAGES (Level 3+)
└─ Break down each major deliverable
└─ Work package must be:
    ├─ Independent (no overlap)
    ├─ Definable (clear beginning/end)
    ├─ Estimable (can estimate duration/cost)
    ├─ Manageable (meaningful unit of work)
    ├─ Integratable (combines to form parent)
    └─ Adaptable (can accommodate changes)
    
└─ Follow 8/80 Rule: 8-80 hours per work package
└─ If longer → Break down further
└─ If shorter → Go up one level

STEP 4: CREATE WBS DICTIONARY
For each work package document:
├─ ID Number (1.2.3 format)
├─ Name
├─ Description
├─ Assigned To (person/team)
├─ Department
├─ Date assigned
├─ Due date
├─ Estimated cost
├─ Dependencies
└─ Acceptance criteria

STEP 5: USE RIGHT FORMAT
Choose one:
├─ Hierarchical (tree structure) - visual
├─ Tabular (table format) - detailed
└─ Text-based (outline) - simple

ADD NUMBERING: 1.0, 1.1, 1.1.1, etc.
```

**WBS Best Practices:**
```
1. USE NOUNS, NOT VERBS
   ✅ "User Login System"
   ❌ "Develop User Login"
   
2. FOLLOW 100% RULE
   Parent = Sum of ALL children
   
3. KEEP MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE
   No overlap between elements
   
4. MIND LEVEL OF DETAIL
   └─ 3-5 levels ideal
   └─ Use 8/80 hour rule
   └─ Stop before using verbs
   
5. USE PM SOFTWARE
   └─ Templates available
   └─ Integrates with schedule
   └─ Easy updates
```

**WBS vs Schedule vs Plan:**
```
WBS (WHAT)
└─ Lists deliverables
└─ Hierarchical breakdown
└─ No timeline
└─ No resources
    ↓
PROJECT SCHEDULE (WHAT + WHEN + WHO)
└─ Adds timelines
└─ Adds resource assignments
└─ Shows dependencies
└─ Gantt chart format
    ↓
PROJECT PLAN (COMPLETE)
└─ Includes everything
└─ Full documentation
└─ All subsidiary plans
└─ How project will be managed
```

**Benefits:**
- Foundation for schedule & budget
- Clear accountability
- Better commitment
- Reduced ambiguities
- Improved communication

## Lectures 13-14: Communication Management

### 🎯 Core Concepts
**Communication**: Greatest threat to projects is communication failure!
**Key Stat**: 80% of work time wasted due to poor communication

**3 Communication Management Processes:**
1. Plan Communications
2. Manage Communications
3. Monitor Communications

**Communication Plan Answers:**
- WHO needs to know?
- WHAT do they need?
- WHEN (frequency)?
- WHERE (location/channel)?
- WHY (purpose)?
- HOW (method)?

### 📊 Problem-Solving Hierarchy

**Create Communication Plan:**
```
STEP 1: IDENTIFY STAKEHOLDERS
└─ List everyone affected
└─ Categorize by:
    ├─ Power (High/Low)
    ├─ Interest (High/Low)
    └─ Impact (High/Med/Low)

STEP 2: ANALYZE COMMUNICATION NEEDS
For each stakeholder:
├─ What info do they need?
├─ How detailed?
├─ How often?
├─ Preferred format?
└─ Delivery method?

STEP 3: DETERMINE COMMUNICATION CHANNELS
Calculate complexity: n(n-1)/2
Examples:
├─ 5 people = 10 channels
├─ 10 people = 45 channels
└─ 20 people = 190 channels!

STEP 4: SELECT COMMUNICATION METHODS
Choose based on:
├─ Urgency
├─ Complexity of message
├─ Need for feedback
├─ Formality required
└─ Geographic distribution

Methods:
├─ Face-to-face (best for complex/sensitive)
├─ Meetings (collaboration)
├─ Email (formal, documented)
├─ Chat/IM (quick, informal)
├─ Reports (status, formal)
├─ Presentations (updates, approvals)
└─ Documents (reference, detailed)

STEP 5: CREATE COMMUNICATION MATRIX
```

**Communication Matrix Template:**
| Stakeholder | Information Needed | Frequency | Method | Responsible | When |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------|--------|-------------|------|
| Sponsor | Project status, budget variance, major issues | Weekly | Email report + Monthly meeting | PM | Monday 9 AM |
| Team | Daily tasks, blockers, priorities | Daily | Standup meeting | PM | 9:30 AM |
| Client | Progress, deliverables, changes | Bi-weekly | Presentation | PM | Every other Friday |
| End Users | Training, features, support | As needed | Email, training sessions | Training Lead | TBD |

```
STEP 6: MANAGE COMMUNICATIONS
├─ Execute communication plan
├─ Distribute information timely
├─ Create performance reports
├─ Hold scheduled meetings
├─ Document decisions
└─ Archive communications

STEP 7: MONITOR COMMUNICATIONS
├─ Verify communications sent as scheduled
├─ Verify right people received info
├─ Verify understanding
├─ Gather feedback
├─ Measure effectiveness
└─ Adjust plan as needed
```

**Face-to-Face Communication Power:**
```
58% = BODY LANGUAGE (gestures, posture, expressions)
35% = TONE OF VOICE (how words are said)
 7% = ACTUAL WORDS (content)
─────────────────────────────────
100% = Complete message

LESSON: Pay attention to MORE than just words!
```

**Communication Barriers & Solutions:**
```
BARRIERS:
├─ Physical (distance, noise)
├─ Language (jargon, accents)
├─ Emotional (ego, anger, fear)
├─ Perceptual (assumptions, biases)
├─ Cultural (different norms)
├─ Organizational (hierarchy, politics)
└─ Technology (poor tools, connectivity)

SOLUTIONS:
├─ Active listening
├─ Clear, simple language
├─ Verify understanding (feedback loops)
├─ Cultural awareness
├─ Appropriate medium
├─ Reduce distractions
├─ Encourage openness
└─ Use multiple channels
```

**Communication Skills Needed:**
```
□ Active listening
□ Strong speaking/writing
□ Conflict resolution
□ Motivation & engagement
□ Managing expectations
□ Questioning & exploring alternatives
□ Recognizing different communication styles
□ Creating trust environment
□ Acknowledging opposing views
□ Asking for help when needed
□ Positive disposition
```

Evaluate change request
    ↓
Is it:
├─ NECESSARY? (compliance, critical)
│   └─ YES → Must do
│   └─ NO → Continue evaluation
├─ VALUABLE? (high ROI, strategic)
│   └─ YES → Consider
│   └─ NO → Likely reject
└─ FEASIBLE? (time, budget, resources)
    └─ YES → Evaluate further
    └─ NO → Reject or defer
    ↓
Decision Matrix:
Necessary + Valuable + Feasible → ACCEPT
Necessary + Not Feasible → NEGOTIATE (adjust constraints)
Valuable but Not Necessary → DEFER to Phase 2
Neither Necessary nor Valuable → REJECT

If Accepted:
├─ Update scope baseline
├─ Update schedule
├─ Update budget
├─ Communicate changes
└─ Track in change log
```

### Problem: Stakeholder Resistance

```
Stakeholder Resisting Change
    ↓
Understand why:
├─ LACK OF AWARENESS

├─ LACK OF KNOWLEDGE
│   └─ Solution: Training, support
├─ LACK OF ABILITY
│   └─ Solution: Coaching, tools, time
└─ LACK OF REINFORCEMENT

### Key Formulas

**Communication Channels**: n(n-1)/2

**Payback Period**: Investment / Annual Cash Flow

**NPV**: Σ[Cash Flow / (1+r)^t] - Investment

**BCR**: PV of Benefits / PV of Costs

**Earned Value**:
- **PV** (Planned Value): Budget for work scheduled
- **EV** (Earned Value): Budget for work completed
- **AC** (Actual Cost): Cost of work completed
- **SV** (Schedule Variance): EV - PV (negative = behind)
- **CV** (Cost Variance): EV - AC (negative = over budget)
- **SPI** (Schedule Performance Index): EV / PV (< 1 = behind)
- **CPI** (Cost Performance Index): EV / AC (< 1 = over budget)
