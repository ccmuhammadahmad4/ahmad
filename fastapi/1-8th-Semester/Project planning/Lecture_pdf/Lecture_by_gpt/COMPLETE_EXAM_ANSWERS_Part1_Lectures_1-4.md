### Q4. What makes a project temporary?

**Answer:**
```
PROJECT TEMPORARINESS - DETAILED
│
DEFINITION:
└─ Project has definite BEGINNING and END
│
START:
├─ Project begins at specific date
├─ Resources allocated
├─ Team formed
└─ Work commences

END CONDITIONS (Project ends when):
├─ 1. OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED ✅
│   └─ Project delivered successfully
│   
├─ 2. OBJECTIVES WILL NOT BE MET ❌
│   └─ Project cancelled/terminated
│   
├─ 3. NEED NO LONGER EXISTS 🚫
│   └─ Business conditions changed

├─ House 2: Different plot, soil conditions, client preferences
└─ Both unique despite being "houses"

UNIQUENESS SPECTRUM:
├─ HIGHLY UNIQUE
│   └─ Never done before anywhere (SpaceX Mars mission)
│   
├─ MODERATELY UNIQUE
│   └─ Done before but in different context (ERP for new company)
│   
└─ SLIGHTLY UNIQUE
    └─ Similar to past but with variations (website redesign)

CONTRAST WITH OPERATIONS:

PROGRESSIVE ELABORATION vs SCOPE CREEP:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ PROGRESSIVE ELABORATION (Good ✅)                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ • Refining EXISTING scope                              │
│ • Adding DETAILS to what was already planned           │
│ • Controlled, expected process                         │
│ • Example: "App" → "iOS/Android app with login"        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ SCOPE CREEP (Bad ❌)                                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ • Adding NEW scope without approval                    │
│ • Uncontrolled expansion                               │
│ • Threatens budget/schedule                            │
│ • Example: "App" → "App + Website + Desktop software"  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

### Q2. Describe the key characteristics of a project in detail.

**Answer:**

```
KEY CHARACTERISTICS OF A PROJECT - COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. TEMPORARY ⏰
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
│
DEFINITION:
└─ Every project has definite BEGINNING and END

DETAILED EXPLANATION:
├─ START DATE:
│   ├─ Project formally begins
│   ├─ Resources allocated
│   ├─ Team assembled
│   └─ Work commences
│
└─ END DATE (Project concludes when):
    ├─ Objectives achieved ✅
    ├─ Objectives will not be met ❌
    ├─ Need no longer exists 🚫
    └─ Resources exhausted 💰

TEMPORARY ≠ SHORT DURATION:
├─ Short Projects: Website redesign (2 weeks)
├─ Medium Projects: Software development (6 months)
├─ Long Projects: Dam construction (5 years)
└─ Very Long: Space missions (10+ years)
    ALL are temporary because they END

AT PROJECT END:
├─ Team disbanded
├─ Resources released to other projects
├─ Budget closed
├─ Documentation archived
├─ Lessons learned captured
└─ Project formally closed

CONTRAST WITH OPERATIONS:
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ PROJECT (Temporary)                              │
│ • Building a factory: 2 years → ENDS            │
│ • Developing software: 6 months → ENDS          │
│ • Marketing campaign: 3 months → ENDS           │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ OPERATION (Ongoing/Permanent)                    │
│ • Manufacturing in factory: NEVER ENDS           │
│ • Maintaining software: NEVER ENDS               │
│ • Daily sales activities: NEVER ENDS             │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

EXAMPLE:
├─ Wedding Project:
│   ├─ Start: Engagement (6 months before wedding)
│   ├─ Activities: Venue, catering, invitations, etc.
│   ├─ End: Wedding ceremony completed
│   └─ Team disbanded: Wedding planner, vendors released
│
└─ Marriage (NOT a project):
    └─ Ongoing relationship with no defined end date

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

2. UNIQUE 🎨
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
│
DEFINITION:
└─ Every project creates something that has NOT been created before

DIMENSIONS OF UNIQUENESS:
│
A. NOVEL PRODUCT/SERVICE:
   ├─ New to the world
   ├─ New to organization
   ├─ New to market
   └─ Example: First smartphone with foldable screen

B. UNIQUE CONTEXT:
   ├─ Different location
   ├─ Different time period
   ├─ Different circumstances
   ├─ Different regulations
   └─ Example: Building same design house in different cities

C. UNIQUE TEAM:
   ├─ Different people
   ├─ Different skills
   ├─ Different dynamics
   └─ Different culture

D. UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS:
   ├─ Specific customer needs
   ├─ Specific constraints
   ├─ Specific quality standards
   └─ Specific success criteria

UNIQUENESS SPECTRUM:
│
HIGH UNIQUENESS:
├─ Never done before anywhere
├─ Example: SpaceX Mars colonization
├─ Example: COVID-19 vaccine in record time
└─ Highest uncertainty and risk

MODERATE UNIQUENESS:
├─ Done before but different context
├─ Example: ERP implementation for new company
├─ Example: Opening new restaurant branch
└─ Some lessons learned applicable

LOW UNIQUENESS:
├─ Similar to past projects
├─ Example: 10th branch of same restaurant
├─ Example: Annual software update
└─ Templates and processes available

EVEN "SIMILAR" PROJECTS ARE UNIQUE:
Example: Building 100 Houses in Housing Society
├─ House #1: Plot #1, specific soil, client A preferences
├─ House #2: Plot #2, different soil, client B preferences
├─ ...
├─ House #100: Plot #100, unique conditions, client Z preferences
└─ Each house project UNIQUE despite same design

WHY UNIQUENESS MATTERS:
├─ Cannot use exact same plan from previous project
├─ Requires custom planning for each project
├─ Past experience helpful but not sufficient
├─ Uncertainty and risk always present
└─ Continuous learning required

CONTRAST WITH OPERATIONS:
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ PROJECT (Unique)                                 │
│ • Each software feature different                │
│ • Each building design customized                │
│ • Each marketing campaign tailored               │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ OPERATION (Repetitive)                           │
│ • Manufacturing 1000 identical phones            │
│ • Processing 100 loan applications same way     │
│ • Answering customer calls using script          │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

│ • Threatens budget and schedule                 │
│ • Requires change request                       │
│ • Example:                                       │
│   "App" → "App + Website + Desktop + Smartwatch"│
│   (New scope added)                             │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

BENEFITS:
