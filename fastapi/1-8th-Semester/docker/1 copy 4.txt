Great! Let's prepare a `.txt` file for **Kubernetes** just like we did for Docker, Dockerfile, and Docker Compose.

## ✅ `kubernetes.txt` File Contents:

This file will include:

1. A **Kubernetes cheat sheet**:
   - Key commands and concepts
   - Description
   - Use case
   - Syntax
   - Practical example

2. A set of **tough interview questions** for Kubernetes:
   - With model answers
   - And explanations

   - Use Case: View exposed services.
   - Syntax: kubectl get services

7. kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- <command>
   - Description: Executes a command inside a pod.
   - Use Case: Debug container.
   - Syntax: kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- <command>
   - Example: kubectl exec -it nginx-abc123 -- bash

8. kubectl scale deployment <name> --replicas=<count>
   - Description: Scales a deployment.
   - Use Case: Increase/decrease pod count.
   - Syntax: kubectl scale deployment <name> --replicas=<count>
   - Example: kubectl scale deployment webapp --replicas=5

9. kubectl rollout restart deployment <name>
   - Description: Restarts a deployment.
   - Use Case: Apply config changes.
   - Syntax: kubectl rollout restart deployment <name>
   - Example: kubectl rollout restart deployment webapp

10. kubectl get nodes
    - Description: Lists all cluster nodes.
    - Use Case: Monitor node status.
    - Syntax: kubectl get nodes

==============================
INTERVIEW QUESTIONS: KUBERNETES
==============================

Q1: What is the difference between a Pod and a Deployment in Kubernetes?
Answer: A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. A Deployment manages Pods and ensures the desired number of replicas are running.
Explanation: Shows understanding of Kubernetes architecture and abstraction layers.

---

Q2: How does Kubernetes handle service discovery?
Answer: Kubernetes uses DNS and environment variables to allow services to discover each other. Each service gets a DNS name.
Explanation: Demonstrates knowledge of internal networking and service communication.

---

Q3: What is the role of kubelet in a Kubernetes cluster?
Answer: Kubelet runs on each node and ensures containers are running as expected. It communicates with the control plane.
Explanation: Shows understanding of node-level operations.

---

Q4: How do you perform a rolling update in Kubernetes?
Answer: Use `kubectl apply` with a new image version. Kubernetes automatically performs a rolling update via the Deployment controller.
Explanation: Demonstrates deployment strategy knowledge.

---

Q5: What is the difference between ConfigMap and Secret?
Answer: ConfigMap stores non-sensitive configuration data. Secret stores sensitive data like passwords and tokens, encoded in base64.
Explanation: Shows awareness of secure configuration management.

---

Q6: How do you troubleshoot a pod stuck in CrashLoopBackOff?
Answer: Check logs with `kubectl logs`, describe the pod, and inspect readiness/liveness probes and resource limits.
Explanation: Demonstrates practical debugging skills.

---

Q7: What is a namespace in Kubernetes?
Answer: A namespace is a logical partition within a cluster to isolate resources. Useful for multi-team or multi-project environments.
Explanation: Shows understanding of resource isolation.

---

Q8: How does Kubernetes handle high availability?
Answer: Through multiple replicas, self-healing, and distributed control plane components. Load balancing and failover are built-in.
Explanation: Demonstrates knowledge of reliability and scalability.

---

Q9: What is the role of etcd in Kubernetes?
Answer: etcd is the key-value store used by Kubernetes to store all cluster state and configuration.
Explanation: Shows understanding of control plane internals.

---

Q10: How do you expose a deployment to external traffic?
Answer: Use a Service of type LoadBalancer or NodePort, or use an Ingress controller for HTTP routing.
Explanation: Demonstrates networking and traffic management knowledge.

```

Would you like me to prepare similar `.txt` content for **Terraform**, **Jenkins**, or **AWS ECS/EKS** next?

Also, once file generation is enabled, I can package all these into downloadable `.txt` files for you.
