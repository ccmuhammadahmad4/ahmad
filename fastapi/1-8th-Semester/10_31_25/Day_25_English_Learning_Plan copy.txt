Conjunctions are words that connect clauses or sentences.

2. Vocabulary Practice: DevOps Terms

| Word           | Meaning                                | Example Sentence                          |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Trigger**    | To start a process                     | The build is triggered after each commit. |
| **Artifact**   | A file produced during build/deploy    | The artifact was stored in the repository.|
| **Repository** | A storage location for code/files      | We pushed the code to the Git repository. |

3. Writing Practice: Status Update Email
---------------------------------------------------------------
✉️ Prompt:
Write an email to your team informing them that the deployment was successful, but an alert was triggered due to high CPU usage.

✅ Example:
Subject: Deployment Status and Alert Notification

Dear Team,

The deployment for the BGS AI service was completed successfully today at 3:00 PM. However, an alert was triggered due to high CPU usage on the staging server. I am currently investigating the issue and will share updates shortly.

Regards,
Muhammad Ahmad

🎯 Task:
Write your own version of this email and check for grammar and tone.

4. Speaking Practice: Explaining a Process
---------------------------------------------------------------
🎤 Prompt:
Explain how you handle alerts in your DevOps workflow. Use conjunctions to connect ideas.

✅ Example:
"When an alert is triggered, I first check the logs to identify the issue. If it's a resource problem, I scale the service. Otherwise, I notify the team and investigate further."

🎯 Task:
Write your explanation, then practice speaking it aloud.
