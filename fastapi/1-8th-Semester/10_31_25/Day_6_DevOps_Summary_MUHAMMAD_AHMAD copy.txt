Dear Sir,

Today at 2:15 PM, we experienced a service downtime due to a misconfigured Nginx file. I identified the issue through logs and monitoring alerts, corrected the configuration, and restored the service by 2:45 PM. I will conduct a post-incident review and share recommendations to prevent recurrence.

Best regards,
