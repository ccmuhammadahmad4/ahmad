Project Planning and Monitoring

Project Change Management
Project Change Management - a general term describing the
procedures used to ensure that changes are introduced in a controlled
and coordinated manner.
Change Request – Requests to expand or reduce the project scope,
modify policies, processes, plans or procedures, modify costs or
budgets, or revise schedules.

Change Order – Used in some companies to identify approved change
requests (change request when the request is made and change order
once it has been approved)

What is Project Change Management?
Project change management encompasses all of the processes
necessary to determine where you are at compared to where you
planned to be and the activities required to get back on track if those
are not aligned

Why is Project Change Management Important?






Projects seldom run exactly according to plan. Project
deliverables must be maintained by carefully and continuously
managing changes, either by rejecting changes or by approving
changes so those approved changes are incorporated into a
revised baseline
Enables the project team to identify potential problems in a
timely manner and take corrective action, when necessary, to
control the execution of the project
Ensures the project team and stakeholders have an accurate
understanding of what has been completed in the project todate and what will be delivered in total

Actual vs Planned
Determining where you are vs. where you planned to
be:
Requires project details be documented and approved



Documented scope, cost, time, quality, people, other (eg. Charter)
 Documented details of product / service functionality (eg.
Requirements Document)


Requires processes and tools to assess performance to
determine whether any corrective or preventative actions are
indicated, and then recommending those actions as necessary
Scope and requirements verification throughout the project
 Budget tracking and forecasting
 Task duration tracking
 Overall project timeline tracking & verification

Getting Back on Track
How can we get on track again?











Identify that a change needs to occur or has occurred
Document the complete impact of requested changes
Follow approved processes for documenting and approving
requested changes
Maintain the integrity of baselines by releasing only approved
changes for incorporation into project products or services, and
maintaining their related configuration and planning
documentation
Control and update the scope, cost, budget, schedule and quality
requirements based upon approved changes, by coordinating
changes across the entire project
Influence the factors that circumvent integrated change control
so that only approved changes are implemented

Perform Integration Change Control


Perform integration change control
is the process of reviewing all
change requests, approving
changes and managing changes to
the deliverables, organizational
process assets, project documents
and the project management plan.

7

Change management activities


Perform Integration Change Control includes
following change management activities:
Influence factors that avoid change control
 Review, analyse and approve promptly
 Manage approved changes
 Maintain integrity of baselines
 Review, approve or deny recommended actions
 Coordinate changes across entire project
 Document impact of changes


Verify Scope


Verify scope is the process of
formalizing acceptance of completed
project deliverables. It includes:
Reviewing deliverables with customer
 Obtaining formal acceptance


Differs from quality control since
quality control is concerned with
correctness of deliverables whereas
verify scope with acceptance.
 Done by inspection.


Control Scope
Process of monitoring status of project
scope and managing changes to scope
baselines.
 Ensures all recommended actions are
processed through perform integration
change control process.
 Variance analysis.

Control Schedule
Control schedule is the process of monitoring status
of project to update project progress and manage
changes to schedule baseline.
 Tools and techniques involved are:




Performance review
Variance analysis
Project management software
Resource levelling
What-if scenario analysis
Adjusting leads and lags
Schedule compression

Resource Levelling
Critical path method calculates theoretical
early, late start and finish dates for activities
regardless of resource limitation.
 Resource levelling is used when shared or
critical required resources are available at
certain times in limited quantity or to keep
resource usage at constant level.
