✅ 1. Being
Incorrect:

The server being restarted now.

Corrected:

The server is being restarted now.

Explanation:
We need the helping verb “is” to make the sentence complete. “Being” is used in passive voice to show that something is happening.

✅ 2. Could
Incorrect:

Could you check the logs yesterday?

Corrected:

Could you check the logs when you get a chance?
OR
Did you check the logs yesterday?

Explanation:
“Could” is used for polite requests or possibilities. If you're talking about the past, use “did” instead. “Could” is better for present or future polite requests.

✅ 3. Would
Incorrect:

I would deploy the code if QA approve.

Corrected:

I would deploy the code if QA approves.

Explanation:
In conditional sentences, the verb after “if” should be in present tense: “approves” not “approve.”

✅ 4. Should
Incorrect:

You should to restart the service.

Corrected:

You should restart the service.

Explanation:
After “should,” we use the base form of the verb (restart), not “to restart.”
