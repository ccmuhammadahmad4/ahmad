📘 Grammar: Adverb Clauses
--------------------------
Adverb clauses are dependent clauses that function as adverbs. They describe when, where, why, how, to what extent, or under what condition something happens.

🔹 Common subordinating conjunctions:
- Time: when, before, after, while, as soon as
- Cause: because, since, as
- Condition: if, unless, provided that
- Contrast: although, even though, whereas

✅ Examples:
- "I check the logs **after** the deployment is complete."
- "**Although** the build failed, we managed to fix it quickly."
- "**If** the server crashes, we will restart it immediately."

🎯 Practice:
Write 3 sentences using adverb clauses related to your daily DevOps tasks.
